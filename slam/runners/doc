First, lets consider some aspects of the pipelines we've used up to now that were sub-optimal:

- Different pipelines often repeated phases to initialize the lens model. For example, pipelines which used a source
  _Inversion_ typically repeated the same phases to initialize the _Inversion_ before going on to fit the final mass model.
  This lead to lots of repetition and wasted processing time!

- Tweaking a pipeline to slightly change the model it fitted often required a rerun of the entire pipeline or
  for one to create a new pipeline that slightly changed its behaviour.

Advanced address these problems using pipeline composition, whereby multiple different pipelines each focused on
fitting a specific aspect of the lens model are added together. The results of the initial pipelines are then reused
when changing the model fitted in later pipelines. For example, we may initialize a source _Inversion_ using such a
pipeline and use this to fit a variety of different mass models with different pipelines.

Advanced pipelines are written following the SLAM method, whereby we first initialize the source fit to a lens,
followed by the lens's light and then the lens's mass.

If you think back to the beginner and intermediate pipelines this is exactly what they di. We'd get the inversion
up and running first, then refine the lens's light model and finally its mass. Advanced pipelines simply use
separate pipelines to do this, each of which has features that enable more customization of the model that is fitted.

__PATH STRUCTURE__

Advanced pipelines allow us to use the results of earlier pipelines to initialize fits to later pipelines. However,
we have to be very careful that our runs do not write to the the same set of samples (e.g. MultiNest
output files). This is especially true given that we can customize so many aspects of a pipeline (the source
pixelization / reguarization, lens light model, whether we use a shear, etc.).

Thus, to make sure that every advanced pipeline writes results to a unique path the pipeline tags for the source,
light and mass we previously added together in intermediate pipelines now instead create their own folder.

For example, if an intermediate pipeline previous wrote to the path:

'output/intermediate/imaging/lens_name/pipeline_name/general_tag/source_tag+light_tag+mass_tag/phase_name/phase_tag

An advanced pipeline will write to the path:

'output/advanced/imaging/lens_name/pipeline_name/general_tag/source_tag/light_tag/mass_tag/phase_name/phase_tag
