    Parameters
    ----------

        The analysis class which includes the `log_likelihood_function` and can be customized for the SLaM model-fit.
    lens_bulge
        The model used to represent the light distribution of the lens galaxy's bulge (set to
        None to omit a bulge).

        None to omit a disk).

    source_disk
        The model used to represent the light distribution of the source galaxy's disk (set to
        None to omit a disk).
    redshift_lens
        The redshift of the lens galaxy fitted, used by the pipeline for converting arc-seconds to kpc, masses to
        solMass, etc.
    redshift_source
        The redshift of the source galaxy fitted, used by the pipeline for converting arc-seconds to kpc, masses to
        solMass, etc.
    mass_centre
       If input, a fixed (y,x) centre of the mass profile is used which is not treated as a free parameter by the
       non-linear search.
    extra_galaxies
        Additional extra galaxies containing light and mass profiles, which model nearby line of sight galaxies.
    dataset_model
        Add aspects of the dataset to the model, for example the arc-second (y,x) offset between two datasets for
        multi-band fitting or the background sky level.

    """
    The SlaM SOURCE LP PIPELINE 2 GROUP, which extends the SOURCE LP PIPELINE 1 to improve the light model of all of the
    additional galaxies that are modeled in a group scale system.

    This pipeline works as follows:

    1) The main lens light, mass and source model, and light and mass of the extra galaxies, have been fitted in
       SOURCE LP 1, meaning that most aspects of the model are good and do not need to be re-fitted.

    2) However, there are many extra galaxies in the field of view outside the smaller circular mask used in `run_1`,
       whose light needs an accurate model to ensure the lens light model is accurate.

    3) This pipeline therefore refits the light of all extra galaxies, including those further out in the mask,
       using the lens light and mass model from SOURCE LP 1.

    This allows us to set up a light-to-mass scaling relationship for the extra galaxies, which is used to fit their
    mass using fewer free parameters.

    This is why the group SLaM pipeline performs fits using two masks, one which is much larger and used in this
    pipeline (and LIGHT PIPLINE 2 GROUP) in order to fit the light of all surrounding extra galaxies.
