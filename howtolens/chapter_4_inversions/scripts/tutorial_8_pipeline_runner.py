Tutorial 8: Pipeline
====================

To illustrate lens modeling using an _Inversion_ and _Pipeline_, we'll go back to the complex source model-fit that we
performed in tutorial 3 of chapter 3. This time, as you've probably guessed, we'll fit the complex source using an
_Inversion_.

We'll begin by modeling the source with a _LightProfile_, to initialize the mass model and avoid the unphysical
solutions discussed in tutorial 6. We'll then switch to an _Inversion_.

 - The lens galaxy's _MassProfile_ is an _EllipticalIsothermal_.
 - The source galaxy's _LightProfile_ is four _EllipticalSersic_'s.

__Settings__

The _SettingsPhaseImaging_ describe how the model is fitted to the data in the log likelihood function. We discussed
these in chapter 2, and a full description of all settings can be found in the example script:

 'autolens_workspace/examples/model/customize/settings.py'.

The settings chosen here are applied to all phases in the pipeline. Note how we can use the _SettingsPixelization_
object to determine whether the border is used during the model-fit.
