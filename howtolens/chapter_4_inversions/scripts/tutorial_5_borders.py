# So, whats happening physically? Towards the centre of our EllipticalIsothermal mass profile (and in general most
# other mass profiles), the density profile becomes extremely cuspy (it begins to rise very sharly). This cause
# extremely large deflection angles to be computed - lets have a quick look.

# This means that our central image pixels are highly demagnified - they trace to extremely large values in the source
# plane! Physically, this isn't a problem - it just means that we don't see a 'central image' in most strong lenses,
# as the light-rays through the centre of the lens are demagnified (although if the lens galaxy had a flat, cored mass
# distribution we would see this central image, and it has been observed in a real strong lens!)

# However, it is a problem for our pixelization and mapper, which in the source-plane fits these demagnified pixels
# like all of the other pixels. This has two devasting consequences:

# 1) The rectangular grid we 'overlay' over the source-plane is much larger than for the annular mask, because it has to
#    expand to also include all of the demagnified traced image-pixels. As a result, large source-pixels are used to
#    reconstruct the central regions of the source-plane (where the source galaxy is actually located), meaning we
#    reconstruct the source-galaxy at a lower effective resolution.

# 2) The rectangular grid reconstructs the flux of the demanigified image pixels, using source-pixels which contain
#    *only* demagnified image pixels. However, these source-pixels *should* have other traced image-pixels in
#    them, coming from pixels at large radii from the centre of the lens galaxy. Unfortunately, our circular mask
#    masks them out, meaning they never make it to our source-plane and are omitted from the source reconstruction.
#    Lets quickly use a larger circular mask to confirm that these pixels do exist, if we don't mask them.

#   This second point is a *huge* problem, as allowing source-pixels to fit regions of our mask in this completely
#   unphysical way introduces extremely dangerous systematics into our source reconstruction and lens model analysis.
#   You can see this in the weird patterns these pixels make in the exterior regions of our source-reconstruction!

# Borders are the solution to this problem. All we do, is we take the mask border in the image-plane we showed above,
# trace it to the source-plane, and relocate all traced image-pixels pixels outside this source-plane border to its
# edge. Lets take a look.

# This successfully addresses both of the issues above! However, you might be thinking, isn't that a bit of a hack? Its
# not really a physical treatment of the ray-tracing, is it?

# Well, you're right, its certainly not the most physical way to tackle this problem. However, the *only* physical
# way to do this would be to use a mask so large that all demangified central pixels are surrounded by traced
# image-pixels. This would require masks so large our computers would crash, because they run out of memory. That's not
# a good solution, thus borders provide us with a workaround - one that I've extensively tested and have found that,
# provided your mask isn't too small, doesn't lead to systematic biases.

# Next, I'm going to quickly highlight how important borders are when modeling multiple lens galaxies. Their complex
# mass distribution and lensing configuration often produce very nasty edge effects, whereby image pixels not in the
# centre of mask, but anywhere in the mask, trace beyond the source-plane border.
