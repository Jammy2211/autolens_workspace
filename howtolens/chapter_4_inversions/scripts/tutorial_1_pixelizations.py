# We'll start by learning about pixelizations, which we typically apply to a source-plane (but could, if we wanted,
# apply to the image-plane).

# Next, lets set up a pixelization using the 'pixelizations' module, which we've imported as 'pix'.

# There are multiple pixelizations available in PyAutoLens, but for now we'll keep it simple and use a uniform
# rectangular grid. As usual, the grid's 'shape' defines its (y,x) dimensions.
rectangular = pix.Rectangular(shape=(25, 25))

# By itself, a pixelization doesn't tell us much. It has no grid of coordinates, no image, and nothing which tells it
# about the lens we're fitting. This information comes when we use the pixelization to set up a 'mapper'.
# (The 'border=None' will be covered in tutorial 5, so just ignore it for now!)
mapper = rectangular.mapper_from_grid_stack_and_border(grid_stack=tracer.source_plane.grid_stack, border=None)

# This mapper is a 'RectangularMapper' - every pixelization generates it owns mapper.
print(type(mapper))

# By plotting our mapper, we now see our pixelization. Its a fairly boring grid of rectangular pixels.
mapper_plotters.plot_rectangular_mapper(mapper=mapper, should_plot_grid=False,
                                        title='Fairly Boring Grid of Rectangular Pixels')

# However, the mapper does contain lots of interesting information about our pixelization, for example its geometry
# attribute tells us where the pixel centers are located
print('Rectangular Grid Pixel Centre 1:')
print(mapper.geometry.pixel_centres[0])
print('Rectangular Grid Pixel Centre 2:')
print(mapper.geometry.pixel_centres[1])
print('Rectangular Grid Pixel Centre 3:')
print(mapper.geometry.pixel_centres[2])
print('etc.')

# Infact, we can plot these centre on our grid - to make it look slightly less boring!
mapper_plotters.plot_rectangular_mapper(mapper=mapper, should_plot_grid=False, should_plot_centres=True)

# The mapper also has the (source-plane) grid sack that we passed when we set it up. Lets check they're the same.
print('Source Grid Pixel 1')

print(mapper.grid_stack.regular[0])
print('Source Grid Pixel 2')
print(tracer.source_plane.grid_stack.regular[1])
print(mapper.grid_stack.regular[1])
print('etc.')

# We can over-lay the regular grid on top. Its starting too look a bit less boring now!
mapper_plotters.plot_rectangular_mapper(mapper=mapper, should_plot_centres=True, should_plot_grid=True)


# Finally, the mapper and its geometry has lots more information about the pixelization, for example, the arc-second
# size and dimensions.
print(mapper.geometry.shape_arc_seconds)
print(mapper.geometry.arc_second_maxima)
print(mapper.geometry.arc_second_minima)

# And with that, we're done. This was a relatively gentle introduction in the world of pixelizations, but one that
# was hopefully easy to follow. Think about the following questions before moving on to the next tutorial:

# 1) Look at how the source-grid coordinates are distributed over the rectangular pixel-grid. Are these points
#    distributed evenly over the rectangular grid's pixels? Do some pixels have a lot more grid-points inside of them?
#    Do some pixels have no grid-points in them?

#  2) The rectangular pixelization's edges are aligned with the most exterior coordinates of the source-grid. This is
#     intentional - why do you think this is?
