Essentially, we set up the mapping between source and image pixels as a large matrix and solve for the source-pixel fluxes in an analogous fashion to how you would solve a set of simultaneous linear equations. This process is called a 'linear inversion'.\n",

If a sub-grid is used, it is the mapping between every sub-pixel and source-pixel that is computed and used to perform the inversion. This prevents aliasing effects degrading the image reconstruction, and, as a rule of thumb, I would suggest you use sub-gridding of degree 2x2.\n",

A similar blurring operation is incorporated into the inversion, such that the reconstructed image and source fully account for the telescope optics and effect of the PSF.\n",
