# Welcome to your first pipeline runner - the module we'll use to run the tutorial 1 pipeline. In PyAutoLens,
# we want every pipeline to be a standalone function that we use to 'make' the pipeline, which we then pass to data and
# run in a pipeline runner. Keeping the pipelines separate from the data is very good practise, as it will encourage us
# to write the most general pipelines possible!

# So, lets start discussing our tutorial 1 pipeline, which fits the lens and source galaxy of a strong lens.

# In chapter 2, we fitted a strong lens which included the contribution of light from the lens galaxy. We're going to
# fit this lens again (I promise, this is the last time!). However, now we're using pipelines, we can perform a
# completely different (and significantly faster) analysis.

# Load up the PDFs from the previous tutorial -
# 'howtolens/chapter_2_lens_modeling/output/5_linking_phase_2/image/pdf_triangle.png'.

# This is a big triangle. As we fit models using more and more parameters, its only going to get bigger!

# As usual, you should notice some clear degeneracies between:

# 1) The size (effective_radius, R_l) and intensity (intensity, I_l) of light profiles.
# 2) The mass normalization (einstein_radius, /Theta_m) and ellipticity (axis_ratio, q_m) of mass profiles.

# This isn't surprising. You can produce similar looking galaxies by trading out intensity for size, and you can
# produce similar mass distributions by compensating for a loss in lens mass by making it a bit less elliptical.

# What do you notice about the contours between the lens galaxy's light-profile and its mass-profile / the source
# galaxy's light profile? Look again.

# That's right - they're not degenerate. The covariance between these sets of parameters is minimal. Again, this makes
# sense - why would fitting the lens's light (which is an elliptical blob of light) be degenerate with fitting the
# source's light (which is a ring of light)? They look nothing like one another!

# So, as a newly trained lens modeler, what does the lack of covariance between these parameters make you think?
# Hopefully, you're thinking, why would I even both fitting the lens and source galaxy simultaneously? Certainly not
# at the beginning of an analysis, when we just want to find the right regions of non-linear parameter space. This is
# what we're going to do in this tutorial, using a pipeline composed of a modest 3 phases:

# Phase 1) Fit the lens galaxy's light, ignoring the source.

# Phase 2) Fit the source galaxy's light, ignoring the lens.

# Phase 3) Fit both simultaneously, using these results to initialize our starting location in parameter space.

# From here on, we'll use the configs in the 'workspace/config' folder, which are the default configs used
# by all pipelines (e.g. not just this tutorial, but when you model your own images and lenses!).

# We'll also put the output in 'workspace/output', which is where output goes for a normal analysis.

# To setup the config and output path, we'll use the relative import below.
workspace_path = '{}/../../../'.format(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))

# To make a pipeline, we call one long function which is written in its own Python module,
# '_tutorial_1_pipeline_lens_and_source.py_'. Before we check it out, lets get the pipeline running. To do this, we
# import the module and run its 'make_pipeline' function.

# When we run the make_pipeline function, we specify a phase_folders which structure the way our output is stored -
# for this pipeline this will output the data as:
# 'autolens_workspace/output/howtolens/c3_t1_lens_and_source/pipeline_name' (the pipeline name is specified in the
# pipeline).

pipeline_lens_and_source = tutorial_1_pipeline_lens_and_source.make_pipeline(
    phase_folders=['howtolens', 'c3_t1_lens_and_source'])

# To run a pipeline, we simply use its 'run' function, passing it the data we want to run the pipeline on. Simple, huh?
pipeline_lens_and_source.run(data=ccd_data)

# Okay, good job, we're running out first pipeline in PyAutoLens! But what does it *actually* do? Well, to find that
# out, now go to the module '_tutorial_1_pipeline_lens_and_source.py_', which contains a full description of the pipeline,
# as well as an overview of some tools we use to write the best, most general pipelines possible. Once you're done,
# come back to this pipeline runner script and we'll wrap up tutorial 1.



# And there we have it, a pipeline that breaks the analysis of the lens and source galaxy into 3 simple phases. This
# approach is signifcantly faster than fitting the lens and source simultaneously from the beginning. Instead of asking
# you questions at the end of this chapter's tutorials, I'm gonna give Q&A's - this'll hopefully get you thinking about
# how to approach pipeline writing.

# 1) Can this pipeline really be generalized to any lens? Surely the radii of the masks in phase 1 and 2 depend on the
#    lens and source galaxies?
#
#    Whilst this is true, we've chosen values of masks radii above that are 'excessive' and mask out a lot more of the
#    image than just the source (which, in terms of run-time, is desirable). Thus, provided you know the Einstein
#    radius distribution of your lens sample, you can choose masks radii that will masks out every source in your sample
#    adequately (and even if some of the source is still there, who cares? The fit to the lens galaxy will be okay).

#    Furthermore, we discussed in chapter 2, tutorial 8 the ability to input custom masks to a phase. You can also input
#    custom masks to a pipeline, which are used by default if a mask_function is not supplied. I haven't included a
#    howtolens tutorial on this, but if you navigate to the workspace/pipelines/examples/ folder you'll find an example
#    pipeline describingn how to do this ('mask_and_positions.py').

# 2) What if my source galaxy isn't a ring of light? Surely my Annulus masks won't match it?
#
#    Just use the annulus anyway! Yeah, you'll masks out lots of image pixels with no source light, but remember, at
#    the beginning of the pipeline, *we don't care*. In phase 3, we'll use a large circular masks and do the fit
#    properly.
