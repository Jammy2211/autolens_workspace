Tutorial 3: Complex Source
==========================

Up to now, we've not paid much attention to the source-`Galaxy`'s morphology. We've assumed its a single-component
exponential profile, which is a fairly crude assumption. A quick look at any image of a real galaxy reveals a
wealth of different structures that could be present - bulges, disks, bars, star-forming knots and so on. Furthermore,
there could be more than one source-galaxy!

In this example, we'll explore how far we can get trying to_fit a complex source using a pipeline. Fitting complex
source's is an exercise in diminishing returns. Each component we add to our source model brings with it an
extra 5-7, parameters. If there are 4 components, or multiple `Galaxy`'s we're quickly entering the somewhat nasty
regime of 30-40+ parameters in our non-linear search. Even with a pipeline, that is a lot of parameters to fit!

we'll use new strong lensing data, where:

 - The lens `Galaxy`'s light is omitted.
 - The lens `Galaxy`'s total mass distribution is an `EllipticalIsothermal`.
 - The source `Galaxy`'s `LightProfile` is four `EllipticalSersic``..

Yep, that`s a pretty complex source. There are clearly more than 4 peaks of light - I wouldn't like to guess how many
sources of light there truly is! You'll also notice I omitted the lens `Galaxy`'s light for this system. This is to 
keep the number of parameters down and the phases running fast, but we wouldn't get such a luxury for a real galaxy.

__Settings__

The `SettingsPhaseImaging` describe how the model is fitted to the data in the log likelihood function. We discussed
these in chapter 2, and a full description of all settings can be found in the example script:

 `autolens_workspace/examples/model/customize/settings.py`.

The settings chosen here are applied to all phases in the pipeline.

# %%
"""
__Pipeline Creation__

To create a `Pipeline`, we call a `make_pipeline` function, which is written in its own Python script: 

 `tutorial_3_complex_source.py`. 

Before we check it out, lets get the pipeline running, by importing the script, running the `make_pipeline` function
to create the `Pipeline` object and calling that objects `run` function.

The `path_prefix` below specifies the path the pipeline results are written to, which is:

 `autolens_workspace/output/howtolens/c3_t3_complex_source/pipeline_name/setup_tag/name/settings_tag`

"""
Okay, so with 4 sources, we still couldn`t get a good a fit to the source that didn`t leave residuals. However, I 
actually simulated the lens with 4 sources. This means that there is a `perfect fit` somewhere in parameter space 
that we unfortunately missed using the pipeline above.

Lets confirm this, by manually fitting the `Imaging` data with the true input model.

"""
And indeed, we see an improved residual-map, chi-squared-map, and so forth.

The morale of this story is that if the source morphology is complex, there is no way we can build a pipeline to 
fit it. For this tutorial, this was true even though our source model could actually fit the data perfectly. For real 
lenses, the source will be *even more complex* and there is even less hope of getting a good fit :(

But fear not, **PyAutoLens** has you covered. In chapter 4, we'll introduce a completely new way to model the source 
galaxy, which addresses the problem faced here. But before that, in the next tutorial we'll discuss how we actually 
pass priors in a pipeline.
