    "__Pipeline 1__\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first pipeline runner, which we'll use to run the tutorial 1 pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "In PyAutoLens, every pipeline is a standalone function which 'makes' a pipeline. We then pass data to this pipeline and run it. This keeps our pipelines and data separate, which is good practise, as it it encourages us to write pipelines that generalize to as many lenses as possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, lets begin by discussing the pipeline in this tutorial, which fits the lens and source galaxy of a strong lens.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter 2, we fitted a strong lens which included the contribution of light from the lens galaxy. We're going to fit this lens again (I promise, this is the last time!). However, now we're using pipelines, we can perform a completely different (and significantly faster) analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load up the PDFs from the previous tutorial - 'howtolens/chapter_2_lens_modeling/output/t5_linking_phase_2/image/pdf_triangle.png'.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a big triangle. As we fit models using more and more parameters, its only going to get bigger!\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, you should notice some clear degeneracies between:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The size (effective_radius, R_l) and intensity (intensity, I_l) of the light profiles.\n",
    "2) The mass normalization (einstein_radius, /Theta_m) and ellipticity (axis_ratio, q_m) of mass profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't surprising. You can produce similar looking galaxies by trading out intensity for size, and you can produce similar mass distributions by compensating for a loss in lens mass by making it a bit less elliptical.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you notice about the contours between the lens galaxy's light-profile and its mass-profile / the source galaxy's light profile? Look again.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's right - they're not degenerate. The covariance between these sets of parameters is minimal. Again, this makes sense - why would fitting the lens's light (which is an elliptical blob of light) be degenerate with fitting the source's light (which is a ring of light)? They look nothing like one another!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as a newly trained lens modeler, what does the lack of covariance between these parameters make you think? Hopefully, you're thinking, why should I bother fitting the lens and source galaxy simultaneously? Surely we can  find the right regions of non-linear parameter space by fitting each separately first? This is what we're going to do in this tutorial, using a pipeline composed of a modest 3 phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 1) Fit the lens galaxy's light, ignoring the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 2) Fit the source galaxy's light, ignoring the lens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 3) Fit both simultaneously, using these results to initialize our starting location in parameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "__RUNNER FORMAT__\n",
    "\n",
    "A runner begins by setting up PyAutoFit, in particular the paths to the workspace, config files and where output is stored. It is then followed by the setup of PyAutoLens, in particular where data is stored and loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here on, we'll use the configs in the 'autolens_workspace/config' folder, which are the default configs used by all pipelines (e.g. not just this tutorial, but when you model your own images and lenses!).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also put the output in 'autolens_workspace/output', which is where output goes for an analysis."
