    "Up to now, all the images we've fitted had one lens galaxy. However, we saw in chapter 1 that our lens plane can consist of multiple galaxies which each contribute to the strong lensing. Multi-galaxy systems are challenging to model, because they add an extra 5-10 parameters to the non-linear search and, more problematically, the degeneracies between the mass-profiles of the two galaxies can be severe.\n",

    "Up to now, I've put a focus on pipelines being general. The pipeline we write in this example is going to be the opposite - specific to the image we're modeling. Fitting multiple lens galaxies is really difficult and writing a pipeline that we can generalize to many lenses isn't currently possible with PyAutoLens."

    "And, we're done. This pipeline takes a while to run, as is the nature of multi-galaxy modeling. Nevertheless, the techniques we've learnt above can be applied to systems with even more galaxies, albeit the increases in parameters will slow down the non-linear search. Here are some more Q&A's\n",

The satellite can't be ignored - it impacts the ray-tracing in a measureable way, but its a lot less degenerate with the 'main' lens galaxy. This means we can often model the  satellite with much simpler profiles (e.g. spherical profiles). So yes, multi-galaxy systems can often be easier to model.\n",

It still requires caution when writing the pipeline, but goes to show that if you name your galaxies sensibly you should be able to avoid errors, or spot them quickly when you make them."
