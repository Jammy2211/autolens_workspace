    "Up to now, all of the image that we fitted had only one lens galaxy. However, we saw in chapter 1 that we can create multiple galaxies which each contribute to the strong lensing. Multi-galaxy systems are challenging to model, because you're adding an extra 5-10 parameters to the non-linear search and, more problematically, the degeneracies between the mass-profiles of the two galaxies can be severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can nevertheless break the analysis down using a pipeline and give ourselves a shot at getting a good lens model. The approach we're going to take is we're going to fit as much about each individual lens galaxy first, before fitting them simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, I've put a focus on pipelines being general. The pipeline we write in this example is going to be the opposite - specific to the image we're modeling. Fitting multiple lens galaxies is really difficult and writing a pipeline that we can generalize to many lenses isn't currently possible with PyAutoLens."

Here are some more Q&A's\n",

The satellite can't be ignored - it impacts the ray-tracing in a measureable way, but this is a lot less degenerate with the 'main' lens galaxy. This means we can often model the satellite with much simpler profiles (e.g. spherical profiles). So yes, multi-galaxy systems can often be easier to model.\n",
