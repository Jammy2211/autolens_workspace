Congratulations, you can now write and use pipelines in **PyAutoLens**!

At this point, I would like you to take a look at the 'autolens_workspace/pipelines' folder. Here, you'll find lots of
template pipelines that perform a range of different lens model fits. In general, I would recommend that you check to
see if a template exists for what you want to do with **PyAutoLens**, before attempting to write a pipeline from scratch.
Of course, many of these templates probably require only minor tweaking to meet your scientific needs.


If a pipeline isn't available for what you need to do, and you go on to write your own, feel free to get in contact
with me to add it to the examples. We really have no idea what science people are ultimately going to do with
__PyAutoLens__, so we have no idea of the weird and wonderful pipelines people will craft along the way!

You should also checkout the 'autolens_workspace/runners' folder, where the corresponding runners which import and run these
pipeines are found. The example runners come as both a Python scripts and Juypter notebooks. I personally prefer to use
runners as Python scripts, but others prefer notebooks. You should experiment with using both and figure out your own
personal preference. Its nice to keep pipelines and runners separate, as it encourages one to separate the analysis
(which the pipeline defines) from the data that analysis is run on (which the runner loads).

Before moving onto chapter 4, there's one more thing I'd like you to do. At this point, you're probably a bit bored of
fitting simulated images. Sure, they're informative, and look pretty, but I think its time you model a real strong lens,
Don't you? The template pipelines and runners are setup to model a real strong lens - 'slacs_1430+4105' - which comes
distributed with **PyAutoLens**. Thus, if you run the pipeline runner, you can quickly get
modeling your first real strong lens - its about time after 3 chapters of HowTolens!
