        "In chapter 2, we fitted strong lens `Imaging` which included the lens `Galaxy`'s light. We`re going to fit this dataset\n",
        "again (I promise, this is the last time!). However, now we`re using pipelines, we can perform a different (and\n",
        "significantly faster) model-fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "The crucial point to note is that for many lenses the lens `Galaxy`'s light can be fitted and subtracted reasonable well\n",
        "before we attempt to fit the source galaxy. This makes sense, as fitting the lens`s light (which is an elliptical blob\n",
        "of light in the centre of the imaging) looks nothing like the source`s light (which is a ring of light)! Formally,\n",
        "we would say that these two model components (the lens`s light and source`s light) are not covariant.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, as a newly trained lens modeler, what does the lack of covariance between these parameters make you think?\n",
        "Hopefully, you`re thinking, why should I bother fitting the lens and source galaxy simultaneously? Surely we can\n",
        "find the right regions of non-linear parameter space by fitting each separately first? This is what we`re going to do\n",

        " 3) Fit both simultaneously, using these results to initialize our starting location in parameter space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, given that we do not care for the errors in phases 1 and 2, we will set up our `NonLinearSearch` to perform\n",
