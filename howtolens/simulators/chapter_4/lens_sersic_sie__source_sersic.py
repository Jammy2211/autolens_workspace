The grid used to simulate the image. 

For simulating an image of a strong lens, we recommend using a GridIterate object. This represents a grid of (y,x) 
coordinates like an ordinary Grid, but when the light-profile's image is evaluated below (using the Tracer) the 
sub-size of the grid is iteratively increased (in steps of 2, 4, 8, 16, 24) until the input fractional accuracy of 
99.99% is met.

This ensures that the divergent and bright central regions of the source galaxy are fully resolved when determining the
total flux emitted within a pixel.

Setup the lens galaxy's light (_SphericalSersic_), mass (SIE+Shear) and source galaxy light (elliptical Sersic) for
this simulated lens.

For lens modeling, defining ellipticity in terms of the  'elliptical_comps' improves the model-fitting procedure.

However, for simulating a strong lens you may find it more intuitive to define the elliptical geometry using the 
axis-ratio of the profile (axis_ratio = semi-major axis / semi-minor axis = b/a) and position angle phi, where phi is
in degrees and defined counter clockwise from the positive x-axis.

We can use the **__PyAutoLens__** *convert* module to determine the elliptical components from the axis-ratio and phi.
