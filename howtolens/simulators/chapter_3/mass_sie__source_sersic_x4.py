"""
This script simulates `Imaging` of a strong lens where:

 - The lens `Galaxy`'s total mass distribution is a *SphericalIsothermal*.
 - The source `Galaxy`'s `LightProfile` is a *SphericalExponential*.

This dataset is used in chapter 2, tutorials 1-3.
"""

"""
The `dataset_type` describes the type of data being simulated (in this case, `Imaging` data) and `dataset_name` 
gives it a descriptive name. They define the folder the dataset is output to on your hard-disk:

 - The image will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/image.fits`.
 - The noise-map will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/lens_name/noise_map.fits`.
 - The psf will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/psf.fits`.

"""
For simulating an image of a strong lens, we recommend using a GridIterate object. This represents a grid of $(y,x)$ 
coordinates like an ordinary Grid, but when the light-profile`s image is evaluated below (using the Tracer) the 
sub-size of the grid is iteratively increased (in steps of 2, 4, 8, 16, 24) until the input fractional accuracy of 
99.99% is met.

This ensures that the divergent and bright central regions of the source galaxy are fully resolved when determining the
total flux emitted within a pixel.

To simulate the `Imaging` dataset we first create a simulator, which defines the exposure time, background sky,
noise levels and psf of the dataset that is simulated.

"""
Setup the lens `Galaxy`'s mass (SIE+Shear) and source galaxy light (elliptical Sersic) for this simulated lens.

For lens modeling, defining ellipticity in terms of the `elliptical_comps` improves the model-fitting procedure.

However, for simulating a strong lens you may find it more intuitive to define the elliptical geometry using the 
axis-ratio of the profile (axis_ratio = semi-major axis / semi-minor axis = b/a) and position angle phi, where phi is
in degrees and defined counter clockwise from the positive x-axis.

We can use the **PyAutoLens** `convert` module to determine the elliptical components from the axis-ratio and phi.
