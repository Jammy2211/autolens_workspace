        "======================================\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous example, we used a `NonLinearSearch` to infer the best-fit lens model of imaging-imaging of a strong\n",
        "lens. In this example, we'll get a deeper intuition of how a `NonLinearSearch` works.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, I want to develop the idea of a `parameter space`. Lets think of a function, like the simple function below:\n",
        "\n",
        "f(x) = x^2\n",
        "\n",
        "In this function, when we input a parameter x, it returns a value f(x). The mappings between different values of x and\n",
        "f(x) define a parameter space (and if you remember your high school math classes, you'll remember this parameter\n",
        "space is a parabola).\n",
        "\n",
        "A function can of course have multiple parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "f(x, y, z) = x + y^2 - z^3\n",
        "\n",
        "This function has 3 parameters, x, y and z. The mappings between x, y and z and f(x, y, z) again define a parameter\n",
        "space, albeit now in 3 dimensions. Nevertheless, one could still picture this parameter space as some 3 dimensional\n",
        "curved surface.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of computing a log likelihood in **PyAutoLens** can be visualized in exactly the same way. We have a set of\n",
        "lens model parameters, which we input into **PyAutoLens**`s `log_likelihood function`. Now, this log likelihood function\n",
        "isn't something that we can write down analytically and its inherently non-linear. But, nevertheless, it is a function;\n",
        "if we put the same set of lens model parameters into it, we'll compute the same log likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can write our log_likelihood function as follows (using x_mp, y_mp, I_lp etc. as short-hand notation for the\n",
        "`MassProfile` and `LightProfile` parameters):\n",
        "\n",
        "f(x_mp, y_mp, R_mp, x_lp, y_lp, I_lp, R_lp) = a log likelihood from **PyAutoLens**`s `Tracer` and `FitImaging` objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "The point is, like we did for the simple functions above, we again have a parameter space! It can`t be written\n",
        "down analytically and its undoubtedly very complex and non-linear. Fortunately, we've already learnt how to search\n",
        "it, and find the solutions which maximize our log_likelihood function!\n",
        "\n",
        "Lets inspect the results of the last tutorial`s non-linear search. we're going to look at what are called `probably\n",
        "density functions` or PDF`s for short. These represent where the highest log likelihood regions of parameter space were\n",
        "found for each parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Navigate to the image folder in `autolens_workspace/output/howtolens/phase_t1_non_linear_search`\n",
        "and open the `pdf_triangle.png` figure. The Gaussian shaped lines running down the diagonal of this triangle represent\n",
        "1D estimates of the highest log likelihood regions that were found in parameter space for each parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "The remaining figures, which look like contour-maps, show the maximum log likelihood regions in 2D between every\n",
        "parameter pair. We often see that two parameters are `degenerate`, whereby increasing one and decreasing the other\n",
        "leads to a similar log_likelihood value. The 2D PDF between the source-`Galaxy`'s `LightProfile`'s intensity I and\n",
        "effective radius R shows such a degeneracy. This makes sense - making the source galaxy brighter and smaller is\n",
        "similar to making it fainter and bigger!\n",
        "\n",
        "So, how does **PyAutoLens** know where to look in parameter space? A parameter, say, the Einstein Radius, could in\n",
        "principle take any value between negative and positive infinity. **PyAutoLens** must of told it to only search regions of\n",
        "parameter space with `reasonable` values (i.e. Einstein radii of around 1\"-3\").\n",
        "\n",
        "These are our `priors` - which define where we tell the `NonLinearSearch` to search parameter space. These tutorials\n",
        "use two types of prior:\n",
        "\n",
        "UniformPrior:\n",
        "\n",
        " The values of a parameter are randomly drawn between a lower and upper limit. For example, the\n",
        " orientation angle phi of a `Profile` typically assumes a uniform prior between 0.0 and 180.0 degrees.\n",
        "\n",
        "GaussianPrior:\n",
        "\n",
        " The values of a parameter are randomly drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean value and a\n",
        " width sigma. For example, an Einstein radius might assume a mean value of 1.0\" and width of sigma = 1.0\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The default priors on all parameters can be found by navigating to the `autolens_workspace/config/priors/` folder,\n",
        "and inspecting config files like light_profiles.json. The convention is as follow:\n",
