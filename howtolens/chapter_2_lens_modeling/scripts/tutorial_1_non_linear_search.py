# In this example, we're going to find a lens model that provides a good fit to an image, without
# assuming any knowledge of what the 'correct' lens model is.

# So, what do I mean by a 'lens model'? The lens model is the combination of light profiles and mass profiles we use to
# represent the lens galaxy, source galaxy and therefore the strong lens ray-tracing configuration (i.e. a tracer).

# To begin, we have to choose the parametrization of our lens model. We don't need to specify the values of its light
# and mass profiles (e.g. the centre, einstein_radius, etc.) - only the profiles themselves. In this example, we'll use
# the following lens model:

# 1) A spherical Isothermal Sphere (SIS) for the lens galaxy's mass.
# 2) A spherical exponential light profile for the source galaxy's light.

# I'll let you into a secret - this is the same lens model used to simulate the image we're going to fit (but I'm not
# going to tell you the actual parameters I used!).

# So, how do we infer these parameters? Well, we could randomly guess a lens model, corresponding to some
# random set of parameters. We could use this lens model to create a tracer and fit the image-data, and quantify how
# good the fit was using its likelihood (recall chapter_1/tutorial_8). If we kept guessing lens models, eventually we'd
# find one that provides a good fit (i.e. high likelihood) to the data!

# It may sound surprising, but this is actually the basis of how lens modeling works. However, we can do a lot better
# than random guessing. Instead, we track the likelihood of our previous guesses, and guess more models using combinations
# of parameters that gave higher likelihood solutions previously. The idea is that if a set of parameters provided a
# good fit to the data, another set with similar values probably will too.

# This is called 'non-linear search' and its a fairly common problem faced by scientists. Over the next few tutorials,
# we're going to really get our heads around the concept of a non-linear search - intuition which will prove crucial
# to being a successful lens modeler.

# We're going to use a non-linear search called 'MultiNest'. I highly recommend it, and find its great for lens
# modeling. However, for now, lets not worry about the details of how MultiNest actually works. Instead, just
# picture that a non-linear search in PyAutoLens operates as follows:

# 1) Randomly guess a lens model and use its light-profiles and mass-profiles to set up a lens galaxy, source galaxy
#    and a tracer.

# 2) Pass this tracer through the fitting module, generating a model image and comparing this model image to the
#    observed strong lens imaging data. This computes a likelihood.

# 3) Repeat this many times, using the likelihoods of previous fits (typically those with a high likelihood) to
#    guide us to the lens models with the highest liikelihood.

# You're going to see a line like the one below (with 'conf.instance') in every tutorial this chapter. I recommend that
# for now you just ignore it. A non-linear search can take a long time to run (minutes, hours, or days), and this
# isn't ideal if you want to go through the tutorials without having to constant stop for long periods!

# This line overrides the configuration of the non-linear search such that it computes the solution really fast. To
# do this, I've 'cheated' - I've computed the solution myself and then input it into the config. Nevertheless, it means
# things will run fast for you, meaning you won't suffer long delays doing the tutorials.
#
# This will all become clear at the end of the chapter, so for now just bare in mind that we are taking a short-cut
# to get our non-linear search to run fast!

# thing with galaxies. This is very good practise - as once we start using complex lens models, you could potentially
# have a lot of galaxies - and this is the best way to keep track of them!)

# When its completed, images and output will also appear in this folder, meaning that you don't need to keep running

# The fit looks good, and we've therefore found a model pretty close to the one we simulated the image with (you can
# confirm this yourself if you want, by comparing the inferred parameters to those found in the simulate function above).

# And with that, we're done - you've successfully modeled your first strong lens with PyAutoLens! Before moving
# onto the next tutorial, I want you to think about the following:

# 1) a non-linear search is often said to search a 'non-linear parameter-space' - why is the term parameter-space used?

# 2) Why is this parameter space 'non-linear'?

# 3) Initially, the non-linear search randomly guesses the values of the parameters. However, it shouldn't 'know' what
#    reasonable values for a parameter are. For example, it doesn't know that a reasonable Einstein radius is between
#    0.0" and 4.0"). How does it know what are reasonable values of parameters to guess?
