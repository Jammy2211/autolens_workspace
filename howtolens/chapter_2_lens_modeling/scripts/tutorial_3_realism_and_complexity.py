# Up to now, we've fitted some fairly crude and unrealistic lens models. For example, we've modeled the lens
# galaxy's mass as a sphere. Given most lens galaxies are literally called 'elliptical' galaxies, we should probably model
# their mass as elliptical! We have completely omitted the lens galaxy's light. So, in this example, we'll start using a
# more realistic lens model.

# In my experience, the simplest lens model (e.g. that has the fewest parameters) that one can fit to a real strong
# lens and still get a reasonable fit is as follows:

# 1) An elliptical Sersic light-profile for the lens galaxy's light.
# 2) A singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass-profile for the lens galaxy's mass.
# 3) An elliptical exponential light-profile for the source galaxy's light (to be honest, even this is a gross
# over-simplification, but lets worry about that later).

# This has a total of 18 non-linear parameters, which is over double the number of parameters we've fitted up to now.
# In future exercises, we'll fit even more complex models, with some 20-30+ non-linear parameters.

# The goal of this, rather short, exercise, is to fit this 'realistic' model to a simulated image, where the lens's
# light is visible and mass is elliptical. What could go wrong?

# Well, there we have it, the input model has a much higher likelihood than the one our non-linear search inferred.

# Clearly, our non-linear search failed. So, what happened? Where did it all go wrong?

# I want you to think about 'complexity'. As we made our lens model more realistic, we also made it more complex. Our
# non-linear parameter space went from 7 dimensions to 18. This means there was a much larger 'volume' of parameter
# space to search. Maybe, therefore, our non-linear search got lost. It found some region of parameter space that it
# thought was the highest likelihood region and focused the rest of its search there. But it was mistaken,
# there was infact another region of parameter space with even higher likelihood solutions.

# This region - the one our non-linear search failed to locate - is called the global maximum likelihood region. At its
# core, lens modeling is all about learning how to get a non-linear search to find this region of parameter space,
# even when the lens model is extremely complex.

# If you did run the phase above yourself, you might of actually inferred the correct lens model. There is some
# level of randomness in a non-linear search. This means that sometimes, it might get infer a locally maximal likelihood,
# and other times find the global maxima another. Nevertheless, as lens models become more complex, you'll quickly find
# yourself stuck within only in local maxima, unless you learn how to navigate parameter space better.


# And with that, we're done. In the next exercise, we'll learn how to deal with our failures and begin thinking about
# how we can ensure our non-linear search finds the global-maximum likelihood solution. Before that, think about the
# following:

# 1) When you look at an image of a strong lens, do you get a sense of roughly what values certain lens model
#    parameters are?

# 2) The non-linear search failed because parameter space was too complex. Could we make it less complex, whilst still
#    keeping our lens model fairly realistic?

# 3) The source galaxy in this example had only 6 non-linear parameters. Real source galaxies may have multiple
#    components (e.g. a bar, disk, bulge, star-forming knot) and there may even be more than 1 source galaxy! Do
#    you think there is any hope of us navigating a parameter space if the source contributes 20+ parameters by itself?
