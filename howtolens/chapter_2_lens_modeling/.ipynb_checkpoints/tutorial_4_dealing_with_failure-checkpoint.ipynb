    "Finally, lets list the advantages and disadvantages of this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage - Its easy to setup, we just increase n_live_points or decrease sampling_efficiency.\n",
    "Advantage - It generalizes to any strong lens.\n",
    "Advantage - We didn't have to make our model less realistic.\n",
    "Disadvantage - Its expensive. Very expensive. The run-time of this phase was over 6 hours. For more complex models we could be talking days or weeks (or, dare I say it, months).\n",

    "#o, there we have it, we can now fit strong lenses with PyAutoLens. And if it fails, we know how to get it to work. I hope you're feeling pretty smug. You might even be thinking 'why should I bother with the rest of these tutorials, if I can fit strong a lens already'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, my friend, I want you to think about the last disadvantage listed above. If modeling a single lens could really take as long as a month, are you really willing to spend your valuable time waiting for this? I'm not, which is why I developed PyAutoLens, and in the next tutorial we'll see how we can get the best of both worlds - realistic, complex lens model that take mere hours to infer!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing that though, I want you to go over the advantages and disadvantages listed above again and think whether we could combine these different approaches to get the best of all worlds."
