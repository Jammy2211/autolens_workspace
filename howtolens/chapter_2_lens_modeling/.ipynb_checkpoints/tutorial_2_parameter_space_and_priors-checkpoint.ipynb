    "__Parameter Space and Priors__\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, we used a non-linear search to infer the best-fit lens model of imaging-imaging of a strong lens. In this example, we'll get a deeper intuition of how a non-linear search works.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I want to develop the idea of a 'parameter space'. Lets think of a function, like the simple function below:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = x^2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this function, when we input a parameter x, it returns a value f(x). The mappings between different values of x and f(x) define a parameter space (and if you remember your high school math classes, you'll remember this parameter space is a parabola).\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can of course have multiple parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x, y, z) = x + y^2 - z^3\n",
    "\n",
    "This function has 3 parameters, x, y and z. The mappings between x, y and z and f(x, y, z) again define a parameter space, albeit now in 3 dimensions. Nevertheless, one could still picture this parameter space as some 3 dimensional curved surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of computing a likelihood in PyAutoLens can be visualized in exactly the same way. We have a set of lens model parameters, which we input into PyAutoLens's 'likelihood function'. Now, this likelihood function isn't something that we can write down analytically and its inherently non-linear. But, nevertheless, it is a function; if we put the same set of lens model parameters into it, we'll compute the same likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write our likelihood function as follows (using x_mp, y_mp, I_lp etc. as short-hand notation for the mass-profile and light-profile parameters):\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x_mp, y_mp, R_mp, x_lp, y_lp, I_lp, R_lp) = a likelihood from PyAutoLens's tracer and lens_fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is, like we did for the simple functions above, we again have a parameter space! It can't be written down analytically and its undoubtedly very complex and non-linear. Fortunately, we've already learnt how to search it, and find the solutions which maximize our likelihood function!\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets inspect the results of the last tutorial's non-linear search. We're going to look at what are called 'probably density functions' or PDF's for short. These represent where the highest likelihood regions of parameter space were found for each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the folder 'autolens_workspace/howtolens/chapter_2_lens_modeling/output_optimizer/1_non_linear_search/image' and open the 'pdf_triangle.png' figure. The Gaussian shaped lines running down the diagonal of this triangle represent 1D estimates of the highest likelihood regions that were found in parameter space for each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining figures, which look like contour-maps, show the maximum likelihood regions in 2D between every parameter pair. We often see that two parameters are 'degenerate', whereby increasing one and decreasing the other leads to a similar likelihood value. The 2D PDF between the source galaxy's light-profile's intensity (I_l4) and effective radius (R_l4) shows such a degeneracy. This makes sense - making the source galaxy brighter and smaller is similar to making it fainter and bigger!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how does PyAutoLens know where to look in parameter space? A parameter, say, the Einstein Radius, could in principle take any value between negative and positive infinity. AutoLens must of told it to only search regions of parameter space with 'reasonable' values (i.e. Einstein radii of around 1\"-3\").\n",
    "\n",
    "These are our 'priors' - which define where we tell the non-linear search to search parameter space. PyAutoLens uses two types of prior:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) UniformPrior - The values of a parameter are randomly drawn between a lower and upper limit. For example, the orientation angle phi of a profile typically assumes a uniform prior between 0.0 and 180.0 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) GaussianPrior - The values of a parameter are randomly drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean value and a width sigma. For example, an Einstein radius might assume a mean value of 1.0\" and width of sigma = 1.0\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The default priors on all parameters can be found by navigating to the 'config/priors/default' folder, and inspecting config files like light_profiles.ini. The convention is as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "[EllipticalSersic] -> These are the priors used for an EllipticalSersic profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "effective_radius=u,0.0,2.0 -> Its effective radius uses a UniformPrior with lower_limit=0.0, upper_limit=2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "sersic_index=g,4.0,2.0 -> Its Sersic index uses a GaussianPrior with mean=4.0 and sigma=2.0"
