    "In this example, we're going to find a lens model that provides a good fit to an image, without assuming any knowledge of what the 'correct' lens model is.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, whats a 'lens model'? It is the combination of light profiles and mass profiles we use to represent a lens galaxy,source galaxy and therefore the strong lens ray-tracing configuration (i.e. a tracer).\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we have to choose the parametrization of our lens model. We don't need to specify the values of its light and mass profiles (e.g. the centre, einstein_radius, etc.) - only the profiles themselves. In this example, we'll use the following lens model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A spherical Isothermal Sphere (SIS) for the lens galaxy's mass.\n",
    "2) A spherical exponential light profile for the source galaxy's light.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll let you into a secret - this is the same lens model used to Simulate the Imaging data we're going to fit and we're going to infer the actual parameters I used.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we infer the light and mass profile parameters that give a good fit to our data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we could randomly guess a lens model, corresponding to some random set of parameters. We could use this lens model to create a tracer and fit the image-data, and quantify how good the fit was using its likelihood (recall chapter_1/tutorial_8). If we kept guessing lens models, eventually we'd find one that provides a good fit (i.e. high likelihood) to the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "It may sound surprising, but this is actually the basis of how lens modeling works. However, we can do a lot better than random guessing. Instead, we track the likelihood of our previous guesses and guess more models using combinations of parameters that gave higher likelihood solutions previously. The idea is that if a set of parameters provided a good fit to the data, another set with similar values probably will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a 'non-linear search' and its a fairly common problem faced by scientists. Over the next few tutorials, we're going to really get our heads around the concept of a non-linear search - intuition which will prove crucial to being a successful lens modeler.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use a non-linear search algorithm called 'MultiNest'. I highly recommend it, and find its great for lens modeling. However, for now, lets not worry about the details of how MultiNest actually works. Instead, just picture that a non-linear search in PyAutoLens operates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Randomly guess a lens model and use its light-profiles and mass-profiles to set up a lens galaxy, source galaxy and a tracer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Pass this tracer through the fitting module, generating a model image and comparing this model image to the observed strong lens imaging data. This computes a likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Repeat this many times, using the likelihoods of previous fits (typically those with a high likelihood) to guide us to the lens models with the highest likelihood."
