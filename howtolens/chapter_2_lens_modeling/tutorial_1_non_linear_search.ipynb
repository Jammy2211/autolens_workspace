        "\n",
        "In this example, we're going to find a lens model that provides a good fit to an image, without assuming any knowledge\n",
        "of what the `correct` lens model is.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, whats a `lens model`? It is the combination of `LightProfile`'s and `MassProfile`'s we use to represent a lens galaxy,\n",
        "source galaxy and therefore the strong lens ray-tracing configuration (i.e. the `Tracer`..\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin, we have to choose the parametrization of our lens model. We don't need to specify the values of its light\n",
        "and mass profiles (e.g. the centre, einstein_radius, etc.) - only the profiles themselves. In this example,\n",
        "we'll use the following lens model:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) A `SphericalIsothermal` Sphere (SIS) for the lens `Galaxy`'s mass.\n",
        " 2) A `SphericalExponential` `LightProfile`.for the source-`Galaxy`'s light.\n",
        "\n",
        "I'll let you into a secret - this is the same lens model used to simulate the `Imaging` data we're going to fit and\n",
        "we're going to infer the actual parameters I used!\n",
        "\n",
        "So, how do we infer the light and `MassProfile` parameters that give a good fit to our data?\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, we could randomly guess a lens model, corresponding to some random set of parameters. We could use this\n",
        "lens model to create a `Tracer` and fit the `Imaging` with it, via a `FitImaging` object. We can quantify how good the\n",
        "fit is using its log likelihood (recall chapter_1/tutorial_8). If we kept guessing lens models, eventually we`d find\n",
        "one that provides a good fit (i.e. high log_likelihood) to the data!\n",
        "\n",
        "It may sound surprising, but this is actually the basis of how lens modeling works. However, we can do a lot better\n",
        "than random guessing. Instead, we track the log likelihood of our previous guesses and guess more models using\n",
        "combinations of parameters that gave higher log_likelihood solutions previously. The idea is that if a set of parameters\n",
        "provided a good fit to the data, another set with similar values probably will too.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is called a `non-linear search` and its a fairly common problem faced by scientists. Over the next few tutorials,\n",
        "we're going to really get our heads around the concept of a `NonLinearSearch` - intuition which will prove crucial to\n",
        "being a successful lens modeler.\n",
        "\n",
        "An animation of a `NonLinearSearch` fitting a lens model can be found on the following page on our readthedocs. Note\n",

        "lens modeling. However, for now, lets not worry about the details of how Dynesty actually works. Instead, just\n",
        "picture that a `NonLinearSearch` in **PyAutoLens** operates as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) Randomly guess a lens model and use its `LightProfile`'s and `MassProfile`'s to set up a lens galaxy, source galaxy\n",
        " and a `Tracer`.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2) Use this `Tracer` and a `MaskedImaging` to generate a model image and compare this model image to the\n",
        " observed strong lens `Imaging` data using a `FitImaging` object, providing the log likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3) Repeat this many times, using the likelihoods of previous fits (typically those with a high log_likelihood) to\n",
