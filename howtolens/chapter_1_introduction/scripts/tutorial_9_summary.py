# In this chapter, you've learnt how create and fit strong lenses with PyAutoLens. In particular, you've learnt:

# 1) PyAutoLens uses Cartesian grids of (y,x) coordinates to perform ray-tracing.
# 2) These grids are combined with light and mass profiles to compute images, convergences, potentials and
#    deflection angles.
# 3) Profiles are combined to make galaxies.
# 4) Collections of galaxies (at the same redshift) form a plane.
# 5) A tracer can make an image-plane + source-plane strong lens system.
# 6) The Universe's cosmology can be input into this tracer to convert units to physical values.
# 7) The tracer's image-plane image can be used to simulate strong lens imaging observed on a real telescope.
# 8) This data can be fitted, so to as quantify how well a model strong lens system represents the observed image.

# In this summary, we'll consider how flexible the tools PyAutoLens gives you are to study every aspect of a strong
# lens system. Lets get a 'fit' to a strong lens, by setting up an image, mask, tracer, etc.

# Using the plotters we've used throughout this chapter, we can visualize any aspect of a fit we're interested

# However, as our fit and ray-tracing becomes more complex, it is useful to know how to decompose their different
# attributes to extract different things about them. For example, we made our source-galaxy above with two light
# profiles, a 'bulge' and 'disk. We can plot the image-plane image of each component individually, if we know how to
# break-up the different components of the fit and tracer.

# And, we're done, not just with the tutorial, but the chapter!

# To end, I want to quickly talk about code-design and structure. Yeah, I know, as a scientist, you don't like code
# and certaintly don't want to think about code! However, the point is, with PyAutoLens, you don't need to!

# Think about it - throughout this chapter, we never talk about anything like it was code. We didn't refer to
# 'variables', 'parameters' and 'functions' did we? Instead, we talked about 'galaxies', 'planes' and a 'tracer'. These
# are the things that, as scientists, we use to visualize a strong lens system.

# Software that abstracts the underlying code in this way follows what is called an 'object-oriented design', and it is
# our hope with PyAutoLens that we've made the way you use it (that is, in coding speak, its 'interface') intuitive.

# However, if you do enjoy code, variables, functions, and parameters, you're probably ready to take a look at the
# PyAutoLens source-code. This can be found in the 'autolens' folder. At team PyAutoLens, we take a lot of pride
# in our source-code, so I can promise you its well written, well documented and thoroughly tested (check out the
# 'test' directory if you're curious how to test code well!).

# Okay, enough self-serving praise for PyAutoLens, lets wrap up the chapter. You've learn a lot in this chapter, but
# what you haven't learnt is how to 'model' a real strong gravitational lens.

# In the real world, we've no idea what the 'correct' set of light and mass profile parameters are that will give a
# good fit to a lens. Lens modeling is the process of finding the lens model which provides the best-fit, and that will
# be the focus of our next set of tutorials.
