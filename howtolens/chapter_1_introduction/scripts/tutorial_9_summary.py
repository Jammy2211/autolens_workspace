Tutorial 9: Summary
===================

In this chapter, you`ve learnt how create and fit strong lenses with **PyAutoLens**. In particular, you`ve learnt:

 1) **PyAutoLens** uses Cartesian `Grid`'s of $(y,x)$ coordinates to perform ray-tracing.
 2) These `Grid`'s are combined with light and mass profiles to compute images, convergences, potentials and
 deflection angles.
 3) Profiles are combined to make galaxies.
 4) Collections of galaxies (at the same redshift) form a plane.
 5) A `Tracer` can make an image-plane + source-plane strong lens system.
 6) The Universe's cosmology can be input into this `Tracer` to convert unit_label to physical values.
 7) The `Tracer`'s image can be used to simulate strong lens `Imaging` observed on a real telescope.
 8) This instrument can be fitted, so to as quantify how well a model strong lens system represents the observed image.

In this summary, we'll consider how flexible the tools **PyAutoLens** gives you are to study every aspect of a strong lens
system. Lets get a `fit` to a strong lens, by setting up an image, mask, tracer, etc.

Using the plotters we've used throughout this chapter, we can visualize any aspect of a fit we're interested in. 
For example, if we want to plot the image of the source galaxy `MassProfile`, we can do this in a variety of 
different ways

As our fit and ray-tracing becomes more complex, it is useful to know how to decompose their different attributes to 
extract different things about them. For example, we made our source-galaxy above with two `LightProfile`'s, a 
`bulge` and `disk. We can plot the image of each component individually, if we know how to break-up the different 
components of the fit and `Tracer`.

And, we're done, not just with the tutorial, but the chapter!

To end, I want to quickly talk about code-design and structure. Yeah, I know, as a scientist, you don't like code 
and certainly don't want to think about code! However, the point is, with **PyAutoLens**, you don't need to!

Think about it - throughout this chapter, we never talk about anything like it was code. We didn`t refer to 
`variables`, `parameters` and `functions` did we? Instead, we talked about `galaxies`, `planes` and a `Tracer`. 
These are the things that, as scientists, we use to visualize a strong lens system.

Software that abstracts the underlying code in this way follows what is called an `object-oriented design`, and it 
is our hope with **PyAutoLens** that we've made the way you use it (that is, in coding speak, its `interface`) intuitive.

However, if you do enjoy code, variables, functions, and parameters, you're probably ready to take a look at the 
**PyAutoLens** source-code. This can be found in the `autolens` folder. At team **PyAutoLens**, we take a lot of pride in our 
source-code, so I can promise you its well written, well documented and thoroughly tested (check out the `test` 
directory if you're curious how to test code well!).

Okay, enough self-serving praise for **PyAutoLens**, lets wrap up the chapter. You`ve learn a lot in this chapter, but 
what you haven`t learnt is how to `model` a real strong gravitational lens.

In the real world, we've no idea what the `correct` set of light and `MassProfile` parameters are that will give a 
good fit to a lens. Lens modeling is the process of finding the lens model which provides the best-fit, and that will 
be the focus of our next set of tutorials.
