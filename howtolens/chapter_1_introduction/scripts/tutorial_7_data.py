Tutorial 7: Data
================

In this example, we'll use the `imaging` module to simulate `Imaging` of a strong lens made using a `Tracer`. By
simulate, we mean that it will appear as if we had observed it using a real telescope, with this example making an
image representative of Hubble Space Telescope imaging.

To simulate an image, we need to model the telescope's optics. we'll do this by convolving the image with a 
Point-Spread Function using a `Kernel` object, which we can simulate as a Gaussian.

To simulate `Imaging` dataset, we use a `Grid`, like usual.

"""
To Simulate the `Imaging` data, we don't use the image plotted above. Instead, we use an image which has been generated
specifically for simulating an image, which pads the array it is computed on based on the shape of the PSF we
 convolve the image with. This ensures edge-effects do not degrade our simulation`s PSF convolution.

# %%
"""
Now, to simulate the `Imaging` data, we pass the `Tracer` and `Grid` to the `Imaging` module`s simulate function. This adds
the following effects to the image:

 1) Telescope optics: Using the Point Spread Function above.
 2) The Background Sky: Although the image that is returned is automatically background sky subtracted.
 3) Poisson noise: Due to the background sky, lens galaxy and source galaxy Poisson photon counts.
