Tutorial 6: More Ray Tracing
============================

In this example, we'll reinforce what we learnt about ray-tracing in the last tutorial and introduce the following
new concepts:

1) That a `Tracer` can be given any number of galaxies.

2) That by specifying redshifts and a cosmology, our results are converted to physical unit_label of
kiloparsecs (kpc).

To begin, lets setup the `Grid`'s we'll ray-trace using. Lets do something crazy, and use a higher resolution `Grid` 
then before and set the sub `Grid` size to 4x4 per pixel!

Every pixel is sub-gridded by 4x4, so the sub-grid has x16 more coordinates.

Lets also stop calling it the `image_plane_grid`, and just remember from now on our `grid` is in the image-plane.

"""
Next, lets setup a lens galaxy. In the previous tutorial, we set up each `Profile` one line at a time. This made code 
long and cumbersome to read. This time we'll setup easy galaxy using one block of code. 
 

we'll also give the lens galaxy some attributes we didn`t in the last tutorial:

 1) A `LightProfile`, meaning its light will appear in the image.
 2) An external shear, which accounts for the deflection of light due to line-of-sight structures.
 3) A redshift, which the `Tracer` will use to convert arc second coordinates to kpc.

Now, lets make two source galaxies at redshift 1.0. Lets not use the terms `light` and `mass` to setup the light and 
`MassProfile`'s. Instead, lets use more descriptive names of what we think each component represents ( e.g. a `bulge` 
and `disk`).

Now lets pass our 4 galaxies to the ray_tracing module, which means the following will occur:

We can next plot the tracer`s `Profile` image, which is compute as follows:

 1) First, using the image-plane `Grid`, the images of the lens galaxy and its satellite are computed.

 2) Using the `MassProfile`'s of the lens and satellite, their deflection angles are computed.

 3) These deflection angles are summed, such that the deflection of light due to every `MassProfile` and both the lens 
 galaxy and its satellite is computed.

 4) These deflection angles are used to trace every image-grid coordinate to a source-plane coordinate.

 5) The image of the source galaxies is computed by ray-tracing their light back to the image-plane.

And with that, we've completed tutorial 6. Try the following:

 1) By changing the lens and source galaxy redshifts, does the image of the `Tracer` change at all?

 2) What happens to the cosmological quantities as you change these redshifts? Do you remember enough of your 
       cosmology lectures to predict how quantities like the angular diameter distance change as a function of redshift?

 3) The `Tracer` has a small delay in being computed, whereas other tracers were almost instant. What do you think 
    is the cause of this slow-down?
