# In this example, we'll fit the ccd imaging data we simulated in the previous exercise. We'll do this using model

# The variable ccd_data is a CCDData object, which is a 'package' of all components of the CCD data of the lens, in particular:

# 1) The image.
#
# 2) The Point Spread Function (PSF).
#
# 3) Its noise-map.

# To fit an image, we first specify a mask. A mask describes the sections of the image that we fit.

# Typically, we want to mask out regions of the image where the lens and source galaxies are not visible, for example
# at the edges where the signal is entirely background sky and noise.

# For the image we simulated, a 3" circular mask will do the job.

mask = ma.Mask.circular(shape=ccd_data.shape, pixel_scale=ccd_data.pixel_scale, radius_arcsec=3.0)
print(mask) # 1 = True, which means the pixel is masked. Edge pixels are indeed masked.
print(mask[48:53, 48:53]) # Whereas central pixels are False and therefore unmasked.

# We can use a ccd_plotter to compare the mask and the image - this is useful if we really want to 'tailor' a
# mask to the lensed source's light (which in this example, we won't).
ccd_plotters.plot_image(ccd_data=ccd_data, mask=mask)

# We can also use the mask to 'zoom' our plot around the masked region only - meaning that if our image is very large,
# we can focus-in on the lens and source galaxies.

# You'll see this is an option for pretty much every plotter in PyAutoLens, and is something we'll do often throughout
#  the tutorials.
ccd_plotters.plot_image(ccd_data=ccd_data, mask=mask, zoom_around_mask=True)

# We can also remove all pixels output of the mask in the plot, which means that if bright pixels outside the mask
# are messing up the color scheme and plot, they'll removed. Again, we'll do this throughout the code.
ccd_plotters.plot_image(ccd_data=ccd_data, mask=mask, extract_array_from_mask=True, zoom_around_mask=True)

# Now we've loaded the ccd data and created a mask, we use them to create a 'lens data' object, which we'll perform
# using the lens_data module (imported as 'ld').

# A lens data object is a 'package' of all parts of a data-set we need in order to fit it with a lens model:

# 1) The ccd-data, e.g. the image, PSF (so that when we compare a tracer's image-plane image to the image data we
#    can include blurring due to the telescope optics) and noise-map (so our goodness-of-fit measure accounts for
#    noise in the observations).

# 2) The mask, so that only the regions of the image with a signal are fitted.

# 3) A grid-stack aligned to the ccd-imaging data's pixels: so the tracer's image-plane image is generated on the same
#    (masked) grid as the image.

lens_data = ld.LensData(ccd_data=ccd_data, mask=mask)
ccd_plotters.plot_image(ccd_data=ccd_data)

# By printing its attribute, we can see that it does indeed contain the image, mask, psf and so on

# Lets use the same tracer we simulated the ccd data with (thus, our fit should be 'perfect').

# Its worth noting that below, we use the lens_data's grid-stack to setup the tracer. This ensures that our image-plane
# image will be the same resolution and alignment as our image-data, as well as being masked appropriately.

#    accounted for by the fit. This creates the fit's 'model_image'.

# 2) Computes the difference between this model_image and the observed image-data, creating the fit's 'residual_map'.

# 3) Divides the residuals by the noise-map and squaring each value, creating the fit's 'chi_squared_map'.

# 4) Sums up these chi-squared values and converts them to a 'likelihood', which quantities how good the tracer's fit
#    to the data was (higher likelihood = better fit).

# Congratulations, you've fitted your first strong lens with PyAutoLens! Perform the following exercises:

# 1) In this example, we 'knew' the correct solution, because we simulated the lens ourselves. In the real Universe,
#    we have no idea what the correct solution is. How would you go about finding the correct solution?
#    Could you find a solution that fits the data reasonable through trial and error?
