Tutorial 8: Fitting
===================

In this example, we'll fit the `Imaging` data we simulated in the previous exercise. we'll do this using model images
generated via a `Tracer`, and by comparing to the simulated image we'll get diagnostics about the quality of the fit.

"""
To fit an image, we first specify a `Mask2D`, which describes the sections of the image that we fit.

Typically, we want to mask regions of the image where the lens and source galaxies are not visible, for example at 
the edges where the signal is entirely background sky and noise.

For the image we simulated, a 3" circular `Mask2D` will do the job.

A `Mask2D` also takes the `sub_size` parameter we are used to giving a grid. This does what it does for a `Grid` - 
defining the (masked) sub-grid used to calculate lensing quantities from a mask.
"""

# %%

    shape_2d=imaging.shape_2d, pixel_scales=imaging.pixel_scales, sub_size=1, radius=3.0

print(mask)  # 1 = True, which means the pixel is masked. Edge pixels are indeed masked.
print(mask[48:53, 48:53])  # Whereas central pixels are `False` and therefore unmasked.

# %%
"""
We can use an `Imaging` `Plotter`.to compare the mask and the image - this is useful if we really want to `tailor` a 
mask to the lensed source's light (which in this example, we won't).
"""

# %%
aplt.Imaging.image(imaging=imaging, mask=mask)

# %%
"""
The `mask` automatically `zooms` our plot around the masked region only - meaning that if our image is very large, we 
focus-in on the lens and source galaxies.

You'll see this is an option for pretty much every `Plotter` in **PyAutoLens**, and is something we'll do often throughout 
the tutorials.
"""

# %%
"""
To fit the data we create a `MaskedImaging` object, which is a `package` of all parts of a data-set we need in order 
to fit it with a lens model:

 1) The imaging-data, including the image, PSF (so that when we compare a tracer`s image to the image instrument we 
 can include blurring due to the telescope optics) and noise-map (so our goodness-of-fit measure accounts for 
 noise in the observations).

 2) The mask, so that only the regions of the image with a signal are fitted.

 3) A `Grid` aligned to the `Imaging` data's pixels, so the tracer`s image is generated on the same (masked) `Grid` 
 as the image.

To fit an image, create an image using a `Tracer`. Lets use the same `Tracer` we simulated the `Imaging` instrument with

image-plane image is the same resolution and alignment as our lens data's masked image.

To fit the image, we pass the `MaskedImaging` and `Tracer` to a `FitImaging` object. This performs the following:

    1) Blurs the tracer`s image with the lens data's PSF, ensuring the telescope optics are included in the fit. This 
    creates the fit`s `model_image`.

    2) Computes the difference between this model_image and the observed image-data, creating the fit`s `residual_map`.

    3) Divides the residual-map by the noise-map, creating the fit`s `normalized_residual_map`.

    4) Squares every value in the normalized residual-map, creating the fit`s `chi_squared_map`.

    5) Sums up these chi-squared values and converts them to a `log_likelihood`, which quantifies how good the tracer`s 
       fit to the data was (higher log_likelihood = better fit).

   2 to 5.
 
 - Bin-up the masked `Imaging` by a factor 2. This decreases the resolution of the data losing us  information, but
