    "__Summary__\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you've learnt how create and fit strong lenses with PyAutoLens. In particular, you've learnt:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) PyAutoLens uses Cartesian grids of (y,x) coordinates to perform ray-tracing.\n",
    "2) These grids are combined with light and mass profiles to compute images, convergences, potentials and deflection angles.\n",
    "3) Profiles are combined to make galaxies.\n",
    "4) Collections of galaxies (at the same redshift) form a plane.\n",
    "5) A tracer can make an image-plane + source-plane strong lens system.\n",
    "6) The Universe's cosmology can be input into this tracer to convert units to physical values.\n",
    "7) The tracer's image can be used to simulate strong lens imaging observed on a real telescope.\n",
    "8) This instrument can be fitted, so to as quantify how well a model strong lens system represents the observed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this summary, we'll consider how flexible the tools PyAutoLens gives you are to study every aspect of a strong lens system. Lets get a 'fit' to a strong lens, by setting up an image, mask, tracer, etc."

At team PyAutoLens, we take a lot of pride in our source-code, so I can promise you its well written, well documented and thoroughly tested (check out the 'test' directory if you're curious how to test code well!).\n",
