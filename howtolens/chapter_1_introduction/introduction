Welcome to HowToLens - The PyAutoLens tutorial!

In this first set of tutorials, we'll learn how to use PyAutoLens. At the end, you'll be able to:

1) Create uniform grids of (x,y) Cartesian coordinates.
2) Combine these grids with light and mass profiles to make images, surface densities, gravitational potentials
   and deflection angle-maps.
3) Combine these light and mass profiles to make galaxies.
4) Perform ray-tracing with these galaxies, whereby a grid is ray-traced through an image-plane / source-plane
   strong lensing configuration.
5) Simulate telescope imaging data of a strong gravitational lens.
6) Fit strong lensing data with model images generated via ray-tracing.
7) Find the model which provides the best-fit to strong gravitational lens imaging.
