Welcome to HowToLens - The PyAutoLens tutorial!

### JUYPTER NOTEBOOKS ###

The majority of these tutorials are supplied as Juypter Notebooks, which come with a '.ipynb' suffix. For those new to
Python, Juypter Notebooks are a different way to write, view and use Python code. Compared to the traditional Python
scripts, they allow:

- Small blocks of code to be viewed and run at a time
- Images and visualization from a code to be displayed directly underneath it.
- Text script to appear between the blocks of code.

This makes them an ideal way for us to present the HowToLens lecture series, therefore I recommend you get yourself
a Juypter notebook viewer (https://jupyter.org/) if you havent't done so already.

If you *really* want to use Python scripts, all tutorials are supplied a .py python files in the 'scripts' folder of
each chapter.

Finally, its worth noting that for actual PyAutoLens use, I recommend you use Pyton scripts. Therefore, as you go
through the lecture series you will notice that we will transition you to Python scripts in the third chapter.

### OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER 1 ###

In this first set of tutorials, we'll learn how to use PyAutoLens. At the end, you'll be able to:

1) Create uniform grids of (x,y) Cartesian coordinates.
2) Combine these grids with light and mass profiles to make images, surface densities, gravitational potentials
   and deflection angle-maps.
3) Combine these light and mass profiles to make galaxies.
4) Perform ray-tracing with these galaxies, whereby a grid is ray-traced through an image-plane / source-plane
   strong lensing configuration.
5) Simulate telescope imaging data of a strong gravitational lens.
6) Fit strong lensing data with model images generated via ray-tracing.
7) Find the model which provides the best-fit to strong gravitational lens imaging.
