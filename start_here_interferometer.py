"""
Start Here: Interferometer
==========================

Strong lenses are observed with radio/mm interferometers (e.g. ALMA), which measure
complex visibilities in the uv-plane instead of CCD images.

This script shows you how to model such a lens system using **PyAutoLens** with as little setup
as possible. In about 15 minutes you’ll be able to point the code at your own FITS files and
fit your first lens.

We focus on a *galaxy-scale* lens (a single lens galaxy). If you have multiple lens galaxies,
see the `start_here_group.ipynb` and `start_here_cluster.ipynb` examples.

PyAutoLens uses JAX under the hood for fast GPU/CPU acceleration. If JAX is installed with GPU
support, your fits will run much faster (a few minutes instead of an hour). If you don’t have
a GPU locally, consider Google Colab which provides free GPUs, so your modeling runs are much faster.

We also show how to simulate interferometer datasets. This is useful for building machine
learning training datasets, or for investigating lensing effects in a controlled way.

The current JAX implementation can only fit datasets with a sufficiently small enough
number of visibilities. The current limit ? visibilities is ~1-2 million, depending on your GPU.
A new version due December 2025 will lift this limit and enable fitting arbitrarily large
datasets. The older non-JAX version of PyAutoLens can fit large datasets (` 2025.5.10.1`) on CPU
relatively fast.

__Google Colab Setup__

The introduction `start_here` examples are available on Google Colab, which allows you to run them in a web browser
without manual local PyAutoLens installation.

The code below sets up your environment if you are using Google Colab, including installing autolens and downloading
files required to run the notebook. If you are running this script not in Colab (e.g. locally on your own computer),
running the code below state you are not in a Colab environment and skip the setup.
"""

from autoconf import setup_colab

setup_colab.for_autolens(
    raise_error_if_not_gpu=True  # Switch to False for CPU Google Colab
)

"""
__Imports__

Lets first import autolens, its plotting module and the other libraries we'll need.

You'll see these imports in the majority of workspace examples.
"""
# %matplotlib inline
# from pyprojroot import here
# workspace_path = str(here())
# %cd $workspace_path
# print(f"Working Directory has been set to `{workspace_path}`")

from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np

import autofit as af
import autolens as al
import autolens.plot as aplt

"""
__Mask (Real Space)__

Interferometer modeling evaluates the lens image on a *real-space grid* and Fourier transforms
to the uv-plane to compare with visibilities. 

We therefore define a circular real-space mask, which sets the pixel grid size and pixel-to-arcsecond 
pixel scale in real space.
"""

mask_radius = 3.5
real_space_mask = al.Mask2D.circular(
    shape_native=(256, 256),
    pixel_scales=0.1,
    radius=mask_radius,
)

"""
__Dataset__

We begin by loading an `Interferometer` dataset from FITS, three ingredients are needed for lens modeling:

- `data.fits`: complex visibilities (shape: n_vis)
- `noise_map.fits`: per-visibility complex RMS
- `uv_wavelengths.fits`: (u, v) sampling of the interferometer in wavelengths

We must also choose a transformer:

- `TransformerDFT`: exact Discrete FT (robust, slower for large n_vis).

Transformers other than the Discrete are disabled for the JAX version of PyAutoLens currently.

We load a low resolution Square Mile Array (SMA) dataset for this example, which has just
273 visibilities.
"""
dataset_name = "simple"
dataset_path = Path("dataset") / "interferometer" / dataset_name

dataset = al.Interferometer.from_fits(
    data_path=dataset_path / "data.fits",
    noise_map_path=dataset_path / "noise_map.fits",
    uv_wavelengths_path=dataset_path / "uv_wavelengths.fits",
    real_space_mask=real_space_mask,
    transformer_class=al.TransformerDFT,
)

dataset_plotter = aplt.InterferometerPlotter(dataset=dataset)
dataset_plotter.subplot_dataset()
dataset_plotter.subplot_dirty_images()  # quick look at dirty image / PSF

"""
__Model__

To perform lens modeling we must define a lens model, describing the light profiles of 
the source galaxy, and the mass profile of the lens galaxy.

A brilliant lens model to start with is one which uses a Multi Gaussian Expansion (MGE) 
to model the lens and source light, and a Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE) plus 
shear to model the lens mass. 

Full details of why this models is so good are provided in the main workspace docs, 
but in a nutshell it  provides an excellent balance of being fast to fit, flexible 
enough to capture complex galaxy morphologies and providing accurate fits to the vast 
majority of strong lenses.

The MGE model composition API is quite long and technical, so we simply load the MGE 
models for the source below via a utility function `mge_model_from` which 
hides the API to make the code in this introduction example ready to read. We then 
use the PyAutoLens Model API to compose the over lens model.
"""

# Lens galaxy

mass = af.Model(al.mp.Isothermal)
shear = af.Model(al.mp.ExternalShear)
lens = af.Model(al.Galaxy, redshift=0.5, mass=mass, shear=shear)

# Source galaxy
source_bulge = al.model_util.mge_model_from(
    mask_radius=mask_radius, total_gaussians=20, centre_prior_is_uniform=False
)
source = af.Model(al.Galaxy, redshift=1.0, bulge=source_bulge)

# Compose model
model = af.Collection(galaxies=af.Collection(lens=lens, source=source))

"""
We can print the model to show the parameters that the model is composed of, which shows many of the MGE's fixed
parameter values the API above hided the composition of.
"""
print(model.info)

"""
__Model Fit__

We now fit the data with the lens model using the non-linear fitting method and nested sampling algorithm Nautilus.

We fit the visibilities with `AnalysisInterferometer`, hich defines the `log_likelihood_function` used by 
Nautilus to fit the model to the interferometer data.

JAX jit and vmap compilation occurs automatically under the hood when `search.fit` is called, ensuring
the model-fit runs as fast as possible.
"""
search = af.Nautilus(
    path_prefix=Path("interferometer"),
    name="start_here",
    unique_tag=dataset_name,  # A unique tag which also defines the folder.
    n_live=75,  # The number of Nautilus "live" points, increase for more complex models.
    n_batch=50,  # For fast GPU fitting lens model fits are batched and run simultaneously.
    iterations_per_quick_update=2500,  # Every N iterations the max likelihood model is visualized and written to output folder.
)

analysis = al.AnalysisInterferometer(dataset=dataset)
result = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

"""
__Result__

Now this is running you should checkout the `autolens_workspace/output` folder, where many results of the fit
are written in a human readable format (e.g. .json files) and .fits and .png images of the fit are stored.

When the fit is complex, we can print the results by printing `result.info`.
"""
print(result.info)

"""
The result also contains the maximum likelihood lens model which can be used to plot the best-fit lensing information
and fit to the data.
"""
tracer_plotter = aplt.TracerPlotter(
    tracer=result.max_log_likelihood_tracer,
    grid=result.grids.lp,  # model evaluation grid
)
tracer_plotter.subplot_tracer()

fit_plotter = aplt.FitInterferometerPlotter(fit=result.max_log_likelihood_fit)
fit_plotter.subplot_fit()  # residuals, chi^2, dirty image, etc.

"""
The result object contains pretty much everything you need to do science with your own strong lens, but details
of all the information it contains are beyond the scope of this introductory script. The `guides` and `result` 
packages of the workspace contains all the information you need to analyze your results yourself.

__Model Your Own Lens__

If you have your own strong lens interferometer data, you are now ready to model it yourself by adapting 
the code above and simply inputting the path to your own .fits files into the `Interferometer.from_fits()` function.

A few things to note, with full details on data preparation provided in the main workspace documentation:

- Supply your own visibilities, noise-map and uv-wavelengths .fits files.
- Ensure the lens galaxy is roughly centered in the image.
- Double-check `pixel_scales` for the real space mask of your interferometer.
- Adjust the mask radius to include all relevant light.
- Start with the default model — it works very well for pretty much all galaxy scale lenses!

__Simulator__

Let’s now switch gears and simulate our own strong lens interferometer. This is a great way to:

- Practice lens modeling before using real data.
- Build large training sets (e.g. for machine learning).
- Test lensing theory in a controlled environment.

To do this we need to define a 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates in the image-plane. This grid is
where we’ll evaluate the light from the lens and source galaxies.
"""
grid = al.Grid2D.uniform(
    shape_native=(100, 100),
    pixel_scales=0.1,
)

"""
We now define a `Tracer` — this is the key object that combines all galaxies in the system
and computes how light rays are deflected.

- The lens galaxy has mass (an isothermal profile + shear).
- The source galaxy has its own light (a SersicCore profile).

Together they define a strong lens system. The tracer will “ray-trace” our grid through
this mass distribution and generate a lensed image.
"""
lens_galaxy = al.Galaxy(
    redshift=0.5,
    mass=al.mp.Isothermal(
        centre=(0.0, 0.0),
        einstein_radius=1.6,
        ell_comps=al.convert.ell_comps_from(axis_ratio=0.9, angle=45.0),
    ),
    shear=al.mp.ExternalShear(gamma_1=0.05, gamma_2=0.05),
)

source_galaxy = al.Galaxy(
    redshift=1.0,
    bulge=al.lp.SersicCore(
        centre=(0.0, 0.0),
        ell_comps=al.convert.ell_comps_from(axis_ratio=0.8, angle=60.0),
        intensity=4.0,
        effective_radius=0.1,
        sersic_index=1.0,
    ),
)

tracer = al.Tracer(galaxies=[lens_galaxy, source_galaxy])

"""
Plotting the tracer’s image gives us a “perfect” view of the strong lens system, before
adding telescope effects.
"""
tracer_plotter = aplt.TracerPlotter(tracer=tracer, grid=grid)
tracer_plotter.figures_2d(image=True)

"""
The image cna be saved to .fits for later use.

image = tracer.image_2d_from(grid=grid)

al.output_to_fits(
    values=image.native,
    file_path=Path("image.fits"),
    overwrite=True,
)

"""
__Simulator__

The images above do not represent real interferometer data, as they do not include the transform of the data 
to visibilities or any noise. 

The `SimulatorInterferometer` class simulates these two key properties of real interferometer data, which we use below to 
create realistic interferometer data of the strong lens system.

The units of the image are arbitrary, with the workspace providing guides on how to convert to physical units for lens
simulations.

The code below performs the simulation, plots the simulated interferometer data and outputs it to .fits files with .png
files included for easy visualization.

uv_wavelengths = dataset.uv_wavelengths

    uv_wavelengths=uv_wavelengths,

    overwrite=True,
)

"""
__Sample__

Often we want to simulate *many* strong lenses — for example, to train a neural network
or to explore population-level statistics.

This uses the model composition API to define the distribution of the light and mass profiles
of the lens and source galaxies we draw from. The model composition is a little too complex for
the first example, thus we use a helper function to create a simple lens and source model.

We then generate 3 lenses for speed, and plot their images so you can see the variety of lenses
we create.

Each lens is simulated as if it were observed with an interferometer, therefore with a PSF and noise-map.
