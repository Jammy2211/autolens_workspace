__Aggregator 1: Samples__

After fitting a large suite of strong lens data, we can use the aggregator to load the results and manipulate,
interpret and visualize them using a Python script or Jupyter notebook.

This script uses the results generated by the script '/autolens_workspace/aggregator/phaserunner.py', which fitted 3
simulated strong lenses with:

    - An _EllipticalIsothermal_ _MassProfile_ for the lens galaxy's mass.
    - An _EllipticalSersic_ _LightProfile_ for the source galaxy's light.

This fit was performed using one _PhaseImaging_ object, and the first four tutorials (a1-a4) cover how to use the
aggregator on the results of _Phase_'s (as opposed to _Pipeline_'s). However, the aggregator API is extremely similar
across both and learning to use the aggregator with phases can be easily applied to the results of pipelines.

__Samples__

If you are familiar with the  _Samples_  object returned from a *PyAutoLens* model-fit (e.g. via a *Phase* or *Pipeline*)
You will be familiar with most of the content in this script. Nevertheless, the script also describes how to use
the aggregator, so will be useful for you too!

__File Output__

The results of this fit are in the 'autolens_workspace//output/aggregato' folder. First, take a look in this folder.
Provided you haven't rerun the runner, you'll notice that all the results (e.g. samples, samples_backup,
model.results, images, etc.) are in .zip files as opposed to folders that can be instantly accessed.

This is because when the pipeline was run, the 'remove_files' option in the 'config/general.ini' was set to True.
This means all results (other than the .zip file) were removed. This feature is implemented because super-computers
often have a limit on the number of files allowed per user.

Bare in mind the fact that all results are in .zip files, we'll come back to this point in a second.

"""
Before we continue, take another look at the output folder. The .zip files containing results have now all been 
unzipped, such that the results are accessible on your laptop for navigation. This means you can run fits to many 
lenses on a super computer and easily unzip all the results on your computer afterwards via the aggregator.
"""

# %%
"""
To begin, let me quickly explain what a generator is in Python, for those unaware. A generator is an object that 
iterates over a function when it is called. The aggregator creates all objects as generators, rather than lists, or 
dictionaries, or whatever.

Why? Because lists store every entry in memory simultaneously. If you fit many lenses, you'll have lots of results and 
therefore use a lot of memory. This will crash your laptop! On the other hand, a generator only stores the object in 
memory when it runs the function; it is free to overwrite it afterwards. Thus, your laptop won't crash!

There are two things to bare in mind with generators:

    1) A generator has no length, thus to determine how many entries of data it corresponds to you first must convert 
       it to a list.
    
    2) Once we use a generator, we cannot use it again and we'll need to remake it.

We can now create a 'samples' generator of every fit, which creates _Sample_'s objects of our results. This object 
contains information on the result of the non-linear search.
"""

When we print this the length of this generator converted to a list of outputs we see 3 different NestSamples 
instances. These correspond to each fit of each phase to each of our 3 images.

   - The log prior encodes information on how the priors on the parameters maps the log likelihood value to the log
     posterior value.
      
   - The log posterior is log_likelihood + log_prior.
    
   - The weight gives information on how samples should be combined to estimate the posterior. The weight values 
     depend on the sampler used, for example for MCMC they will all be 1's.
