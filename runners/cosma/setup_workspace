### SETUP Workspace ###

Before using the Cosma pipeline runner, we need to setup a workspace on Cosma on your home directory
('/cosma/home/durham/cosma_username'). Your home directory has a limited amount of hard-disk space, so it
is key that the parts of your laptop's workspace which store large amounts of data (e.g. the data and output folders)
are omitted from this workspace and stored somewhere else on Cosma.

To setup your cosma PyAutoLens workspace, the following commands should work from a terminal:

1) ssh -X cosma_username@login.cosma.dur.ac.uk

   This command ssh's you into cosma, and should be something you're familiar with. It'll log you into your home
   directory ('/cosma/home/durham/cosma_username').

2) mkdir PyAutoLens

   This makes the directory 'PyAutoLens' on cosma, where we'll put the workspace. You MUST put your workspace in a
   PyAutoLens directory for your Cosma runs to work.

3) cd PyAutoLens

   This takes us into the PyAutoLens directory.

2) cp -r /cosma/home/durham/pdtw24/PyAutoLens/workspace .

   This command will copy my template cosma workspace from my cosma PyAutoLens directory to yours. This workspace
   includes example scripts to help you learn how to use Cosma.

Now we need to setup your cosma environment so that it can run PyAutoLens.

module purge
module load python/3.6.5
source /cosma/home/durham/pdtw24/PyAutoLens/bin/activate

You will have to run the commands above every time you log into Cosma. To make this your default setup (e.g. if you're
only going to be using PyAutoLens on Cosma) you can add the lines above to your .bashrc file:

emacs -nw $HOME/.bashrc

then copy and paste the 3 commands above (module purge, module import, etc.) into this file.

Now, we need to setup the directories that we'll store our data and PyAutoLens output on cosma. Logged into cosma
(e.g. via ssh), type the following command to go to your data directory:

cd /cosma5/data/autolens
dir

This should bring up a number of directories, named after cosma usernames (e.g. pdtw24) or 'share'. We'll discuss the
'share' directory in a moment, for now, lets make a folder for your personal Cosma output.

mkdir cosma_username
cd cosma_username

Finally, we'll make our data and output folders, which we'll next transfer our data into.

mkdir data
mkdir output

### TRANSFERRING DATA ###

We are going to need to send files from your laptop to Cosma, and visa versa. On Cosma, the data and output files of
PyAutolens are stored in a separate directory to the workspace, which can be found at the path we just created,
'/cosma5/data/autolens/cosma_username/'. This is because the large amounts of data storage required on super
computer are kept in a separate location to your cosma home directory.

Thus, we need some neat tools that allow us to upload the data / output folders on our laptop to this directory on
Cosma, and conversely download the results of a PyAutoLens analysis on Cosma to our workspace. The command 'rsync'
has us covered, and we'll use 3 custom options of rsync:

1) --update, which only sends data which has been updated on your laptop / Cosma. Thus, it ensures we don't resend our
    entire data-set or set of results every time we perform a file transfer. Phew!

2) -v, this stands for verbose, and gives text output of the file transfer's progress.

3) -r, we'll send folders full of data rather than individual files, and this r allows us to send entire folders.

Before running rsync, you should navigate your command line to your laptop's PyAutoLens workspace.

cd /path/to/workspace

Now we're in our workspace, the following rsync commands can be used to send you data and output to Cosma:

### To upload data from your laptop to Cosma ###

rsync --update -v -r data/* cosma_username@login.cosma.dur.ac.uk:/cosma5/data/autolens/cosma_username/data/

### To upload output from your laptop to Cosma ###

rsync --update -v -r output/* cosma_username@login.cosma.dur.ac.uk:/cosma5/data/autolens/cosma_username/output/

The * symbols above are 'wildcards', and they mean all folders in the data and output directories will be sent. If we
wanted to just send one data or output folder (e.g., named 'example'), we would write:

rsync --update -v -r data/example_username@login.cosma.dur.ac.uk:/cosma5/data/autolens/cosma_username/data/
rsync --update -v -r output/example cosma_username@login.cosma.dur.ac.uk:/cosma5/data/autolens/cosma_username/output/

We also need to use rsync to send our pipelines to our cosma home directory, which the command below does (note that
we're sending these to a different directory than the data / output above):

### To upload pipelines from your laptop to Cosma ###

rsync --update -v -r pipelines cosma_username@login.cosma.dur.ac.uk:/cosma/home/durham/cosma_username/PyAutoLens/workspace/

You will also need to send your runners to Cosma. Your runners for cosma are different to those on your laptop, and it
is good practise to keep them separate on your laptop in the 'workspace/runners/cosma' folder. The command below sends
only your Cosma runners to Cosma.

### To upload runners from your laptop to Cosma ###

rsync --update -v -r runners/cosma/* cosma_username@login.cosma.dur.ac.uk:/cosma/home/durham/cosma_username/PyAutoLens/workspace/runners/

Next, lets send our config files to Cosma. New versions of PyAutoLens often require new config files - I will notify you
on SLACK when I update PyAutoLens on Cosma and new configs must be updloaded to Cosma. Furtheremore, if you edit
configs on your laptop to customize the analysis, you will need to upload them to Cosma for them to be used.

rsync --update -v -r config cosma_username@login.cosma.dur.ac.uk:/cosma/home/durham/PyAutoLens/cosma_username/workspace/

The following rsync commands can be used to download your data and output from Cosma:

### To download data from Cosma to your laptop ###

rsync --update -v -r cosma_username@login.cosma.dur.ac.uk:/cosma5/data/autolens/cosma_username/data/* ./data/

### To download output from Cosma to your laptop ###

rsync --update -v -r cosma_username@login.cosma.dur.ac.uk:/cosma5/data/autolens/cosma_username/output/* ./output/

### SHARED DATA AND OUTPUT ###

We mentiond the 'share' folder above, which is found in /cosma5/data/autolens/. For big projects, it will prove
benefitial if we are able to all share the same data and output, for the following reasons:

- By sharing data and output, we reduce the amount of storage we use on Cosma.
- Auxilary data we create (e.g. custom masks, positions) can be used by others.
- We can build pipelines that continue an analysis of someone else, thus saving us time in how long pipelines take to
  run.
- It will be a lot easier to inspect the results of others for discussion.

In general, I would recommend you aim to use the 'share' directory. Its important that we communicate who is doing what
analysis when, as if pipelines that use the same shared output folder are set off on Cosma at the same time the sripts
will crash. However, this downside is far outweighted by the flexibility it will offer us in analysing large samples of
lens on Cosma.


Now you're setup, we're ready to run our first PyAutoLens analysis on Cosma. go to the
'workspace/runners/cosma/example.py' script to learn about how we submit PyAutoLens jobs to Cosma.
