The batch script is the script we pass to Cosma, to tell it the code and analysis we want to run with PyAutoLens. Lets
go through each line, and note where we might need to make changes.

#!/bin/bash -l

This sets up the Cosma command line of the job, so we can run command line calls like we normally do in a terminal.

#SBATCH --ntasks 1

This describes the number of tasks we're going to run on Cosma. A

#SBATCH -J pipeline_runner_cosma

This specifies the name of the job, which I generally make sure matches the name of the runner.

#SBATCH --array=1-17

This specieis the range of arrays we'll run on, and thus the range of array_ids we'll pass the code. You can tell Cosma
to run just one job on a specif array by writing e.g.

#SBATCH --array=2

You will want to edit this line of the batch script depending on the number lenses you are analysing.

#SBATCH -o ../output/pipeline_runner_cosma_output.%A.%a.out

The Python output of the job is sent to a .out file, which I by default put in the folder
/workspace/runners/cosma/output/ and name after your runner, e.g. pipeine_runner_cosma_output.out

#SBATCH -e ../output/pipeline_runner_cosma_error.%A.%a.err

If there is an error during the job, the error is output to .err file which is setup analogously to the output file above.

#SBATCH -p cosma # also cordelia

You shouldn't need to change this, its telling Cosma which queue on the super computer we want to send our job too.

#SBATCH -A durham

Again, don't change this, its just letting Cosma know this is a Durham job.

#SBATCH -t 1:00:00   # longest job

This is the anticipated run time of your entire batch of jobs. All jobs will end when this timer is reached, thus you
should put run time of the job you expect to last the longest. The limit on run-times on Cosma is 72 hours, but if this
isn't enough you can just keep resubmitting jobs after they end and PyAutoLens will resume.

#SBATCH --mail-type=END                          # notifications for job done & fail

This species when we want a notification on the job, with the line above saying we want it when the job ends.

#SBATCH --mail-user=username@durham.ac.uk

This specifies the notifcation type, and I find an email is useful.

module purge
module load python/3.6.5
source /cosma/home/durham/pdtw24/PyAutoLens/bin/activate
python3 $HOME/workspace/runners/cosma/pipeline_runner_cosma.py

The remaining four lines are the same ones you used when you setup yourself on Cosma. These lines basically do the same
thing but for each job.
