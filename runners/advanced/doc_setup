Advanced pipelines have a number of additional settings that can be passed to the source, light or mass Setup
objects.

These options typically apply to only their corresponding pipeline, e.g. the Source setup options only change the
beheviour of the source pipeline(s).

They may also change the model fitted in later pipelines.

# GENERAL #

    Below, we given an example of a General setup using all options available to an advanced pipeline:

    general_setup = al.setup.General(
        hyper_galaxies=False,
        hyper_background_noise=False,
        hyper_image_sky=False,
    )

    hyper_galaxies : bool (default=False)

        If true, hyper-galaxies are used to scale the noise-map between all phases of each pipeline.

    hyper_background_noise : bool (default=False)

        If true, the level of background noise is modeled throughout the pipeline.

    hyper_image_sky : bool (default=False)

        If true, the background sky is modeled throughout the pipeline.

# SOURCE #

    Below, we give an example of a Source setup using all options available to an advanced pipeline:

    source_setup = al.setup.Source(
        pixelization=al.pix.VoronoiBrightnessImage,
        regularization=al.reg.AdaptiveBrightness,
        lens_light_centre=(0.0, 0.0),
        lens_mass_centre=(0.0, 0.0),
        align_light_mass_centre=False,
        no_shear=False,
        lens_light_bulge_only=True,
        fix_lens_light=True,
    )


    pixelization : al.pix

        If a source inversion pipeline is run, this sets the pixelization used by the source inversion.
        This pixelization will be used by all subsequent pipelines (e.g. light, mass, etc.).

        If a source inversion pipeline is not run (e.g. only a parametric source pipeline is used) this pixelization
        is not used and the parametric source model is used by all subsequent pipelines (e.g. light, mass, etc.).

    regularization : al.reg

        If a source inversion pipeline is run, this sets the regularization used by the source inversion.
        This regularization will be used by all subsequent pipelines (e.g. light, mass, etc.).

        If a source inversion pipeline is not run (e.g. only a parametric source pipeline is used) this regularization
        is not used and the parametric source model is used by all subsequent pipelines (e.g. light, mass, etc.).

    lens_light_centre : (float, float)

        If input, the centre of the lens light profiles (An EllipticalSersic + EllipticalSersic) are fixed to the input
        tuple instead of being fitted for as free parameters.

    lens_mass_centre : (float, float)

        If input, the centre of the lens mass profile (an EllipticalIsothermal) is fixed to the input tuple instead of
        being fitted for as free parameters.

    align_light_mass_centre : bool (default=False)

        If True, the centre of the lens light profile(s) and mass profile(s) are aligned during the model-fitting.

        If both the lens_light_centre and lens_mass_centre tuples are input, this option is disabled.

    no_shear : bool (default=False)

        If True, the source pipeline does not include a shear in the lens mass model.

        This mass model is used in a subsequent 'light' pipeline.

    lens_light_bulge_only : bool (default=False)

        If True, the lens light model will only include its bulge component (e.g. x1 EllipticalSersic) as opposed to a
        bulge and disk (e.g. EllipticalSersic + EllipticalExponential).

    fix_lens_light : bool (default=True)

        If True, the lens light model is fixed after phase 3 of the parametric source pipeline (e.g. in phase 4 and
        all phases of the source inversion pipeline).


# Light #

    Below, we give an example of a Light setup using all options available to an advanced pipeline:

    light_setup = al.setup.Light(
        align_bulge_disk_centre=True,
        align_bulge_disk_axis_ratio=False,
        align_bulge_disk_phi=False,
        disk_as_Sersic=True,
    )

    align_bulge_disk_centre : bool (default=True)

        If a bulge_disk light pipeline is run, this determines if the centre of bulge and disk components are aligned
        during the model fit.

        This bulge-disk centroid alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines (e.g. mass).

    align_bulge_disk_axis_ratio : bool (default=False)

        If a bulge_disk light pipeline is run, this determines if the axis_ratio's of bulge and disk components are
        forced to be the same during the model fit.

        This bulge-disk axis-ratio alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines (e.g. mass).

    align_bulge_disk_phi : bool (default=False)

        If a bulge_disk light pipeline is run, this determines if the centre of bulge and disk components are aligned
        during the model fit.

        This bulge-disk rotational alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines (e.g. mass).

    disk_as_sersic : bool (default=False)

        If True, the disk component of the bulge-disk lens light profile will be modeled using an EllipticalSersic
        profile as opposed to an EllipticalExponential.

        This disk model will be used in all subsequents pipelines (e.g. mass).


# Mass #

    Below, we give an example of a Mass setup using all options available to an advanced pipeline:

    mass_setup = al.setup.Mass(
        no_shear=False,
        align_light_dark_centre=False,
        align_bulge_dark_centre=False,
        fix_lens_light=False,
    )


    no_shear : bool (default=False)

        If True, the mass pipeline does not include a shear in the lens mass model.

        This mass model is used in any subsequent pipeline.

    align_light_dark_centre : bool (default=False)

        If a light_dark mass pipeline is run using a light profile composed of a single light profile (e.g. just a
        Sersic), this determines if the centre of the dark component (an NFW) and the light profile are forced to be the
        same during the model fit.

        This light-dark centroid alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines.

    align_bulge_dark_centre : bool (default=False)

        If a light_dark mass pipeline is run using a light profile composed of a bulge-disk light profile, this
        determines if the centre of the dark component (an NFW) and the bulge profile are forced to be the
        same during the model fit.

        This bulge-dark centroid alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines.

    fix_lens_light : bool (default=False)

        If True, the lens light model is fixed during the mass pipeline.
