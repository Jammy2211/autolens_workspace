These runners model strong lens images where the lens galaxy's light is not present. This may be because:

- The strong lens image is a simulated image which omitted the lens light component.
- The strong lens image's lens galaxy light was subtracted during data-reduction.
- The strong lens imaging is observed at submm / radio wavelengths where only the lensed source's light is visible.

The runners use pipelines that fit the different components of the strong lens as follows:

LENS MASS:

The runners use 'total-mass models' that represents all of the lens galaxy's matter (e.g. stellar and dark). The
profiles used are elliptical Isothermal and Power-Law profiles.

SOURCE LIGHT:

The runners use either a a single elliptical Sersic profile or a pixelized source reconstruction (or 'inversion').
