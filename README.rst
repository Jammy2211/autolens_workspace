PyAutoLens Workspace
====================

Welcome to the **PyAutoLens** Workspace. If you haven't already, you should install **PyAutoLens**, following the
instructions at `the PyAutoLens readthedocs <https://pyautolens.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html>`_.

Workspace Version
=================

This version of the workspace are built and tested for using **PyAutoLens v1.6.0**.

Getting Started
===============

To get started checkout the `workspace tour on our readthedocs <https://pyautolens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workspace.html>`_.

Workspace Contents
==================

New users should begin by exploring the following parts of the workspace:

- **Examples**: Illustrative scripts of the **PyAutoLens** interface, for examples on how to perform lensing calculations, model lenses, etc.
- **Config**: Configuration files which customize **PyAutoLens**'s behaviour.
- **Dataset**: Where data is stored, including example datasets distributed with **PyAutoLens**.
- **HowToLens**: The **HowToLens** lecture series.
- **Output**: Where the **PyAutoLens** analysis and visualization are output.
- **Simulators**: Scripts for simulating strong lens datasets with **PyAutoLens**.

For advanced **PyAutoLens** use the workspace also contains:

- **Aggregator**: Manipulate large suites of modeling results via Jupyter notebooks, using **PyAutoFit**'s in-built results database.
- **Preprocess**: Tools to preprocess data before an analysis (e.g. convert units, create masks).
- **Transdimensional**: Example transdimensional pipelines for modeling strong lenses.
- **SLaM**: Example pipelines for using the Source, Light and Mass (SLaM) lens modeling approach.

HowToLens
---------

Included with **PyAutoLens** is the **HowToLens** lecture series, which provides an introduction to strong gravitational
lens modeling with **PyAutoLens**. It can be found in the workspace & consists of 5 chapters:

- **Introduction**: An introduction to strong gravitational lensing & **PyAutolens**.
- **Lens Modeling**: How to model strong lenses, including a primer on Bayesian non-linear analysis.
- **Pipelines**: How to build model-fitting pipelines & tailor them to your own science case.
- **Inversions**: How to perform pixelized reconstructions of the source-galaxy.
- **Hyper-Mode**: How to use **PyAutoLens** advanced modeling features that adapt the model to the strong lens being analysed.

Issues, Help and Problems
=========================

If the installation below does not work or you have issues running scripts in the workspace, please post an issue on
