Welcome to the **PyAutoLens** Workspace!

## Getting Started

### Human-Readable Documentation and Examples

The following human-readable documentation and examples are useful for new starters:

- [Installation guide](https://pyautolens.readthedocs.io/): set up **PyAutoLens** on your personal computer.
- [PyAutoLens on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PyAutoLabs/autolens_workspace/blob/2026.9.8.1/start_here.ipynb): try **PyAutoLens** in a web browser without installing it.

### PyAutoLens AI Assistant

The [**PyAutoLens AI Assistant**](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant) supports conversation agents such as ChatGPT and coding agents such as Claude Code and Codex. You can get started simply by asking it a question about gravitational lensing or describing the task you would like to perform with **PyAutoLens**. See the [autolens_assistant GitHub page](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant) for its full scope and instructions.

**The PyAutoLens AI Assistant currently requires a paid subscription: Claude Code or Codex as a coding agent, or ChatGPT or Claude on a paid plan as a conversation assistant. Free options are being tested.**

## New Users

New users should read the `autolens_workspace/start_here.ipynb` notebook, which will give you a concise
overview of **PyAutoLens**'s core features and API.

This can be done via a web browser by going to the following Google Colab link:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/PyAutoLabs/autolens_workspace/blob/2026.9.8.1/start_here.ipynb

Then checkout the [new user starting guide](https://pyautolens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/overview_2_new_user_guide.html) to navigate the
workspace for your science case.

You can also [browse a curated set of examples fully executed, with their output images](markdown/README.md),
directly on GitHub — no installation required.

## HowToLens

If the workspace examples move too quickly, **HowToLens** is a separate four-chapter tutorial lecture series that walks
through strong lensing and lens modeling step by step — ideal for undergraduates, new PhD students, or anyone new to the
field. It lives in its own repository: [PyAutoLabs/HowToLens](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/HowToLens).

## Workspace Structure

The workspace includes the following main directories:

- `notebooks`: **PyAutoLens** examples written as Jupyter notebooks.
- `scripts`: **PyAutoLens** examples written as Python scripts.
- `config`: Configuration files which customize **PyAutoLens**'s behaviour.
- `dataset`: Where data is stored, including example datasets distributed.
- `output`: Where the **PyAutoLens** analysis and visualization are output.
- `markdown`: Curated examples rendered with their output images, browsable on GitHub.
- `.claude/skills`: AI agent skills (e.g. Claude, codex) for loading, inspecting and analysing workspace results with AI agents.

The Source, Light and Mass (SLaM) pipelines **(Advanced)** are not a top-level
directory: `scripts/guides/modeling/slam_start_here.py` is the canonical
reference, and the pipelines themselves live in `features/slam/` folders within a
given topic (e.g. `scripts/multi_dataset/features/slam/`).

The examples in the `notebooks` and `scripts` folders are structured as follows:

- `guides`: Guides which introduce the core features of **PyAutoLens**, including the core lensing API.
- `imaging`: Examples for galaxy scale strong lenses observed with CCD imaging (e.g. Hubble, Euclid).
- `interferometer`: Examples for galaxy scale strong lenses observed with an interferometer (e.g. ALMA, JVLA), for both continuum data and spectral-line data cubes.
- `multi_dataset`: Examples for lenses observed in multiple wavebands, modeled simultaneously.
- `point_source`: Examples for strong lens point source datasets.
- `multi_galaxy`: Examples for multi-galaxy strong lenses (two or more co-dominant lens galaxies, no host halo).
- `group`: Examples for group scale strong lenses.
- `cluster`: Examples for cluster scale strong lenses.
- `weak`: Examples for weak lensing analysis.

The tutorial lecture series is shipped as a standalone repo: [PyAutoLabs/HowToLens](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/HowToLens).

The dataset packages (e.g. `imaging`, `interferometer`, `point_source`, `group` and `cluster`) include the
following types of examples:

- `modeling`: Performing lens modeling using that type of data.
- `simulator`: Simulating examples of that strong lens dataset type.
- `fit`: How to fit the dataset to compute quantities like the residuals, chi squared and likelihood.
- `data_preparation`: Preparing real datasets of that type for **PyAutoLens** analysis.
- `source_science`: Performing source science calculations like computing the unlensed source's total flux and magnification.
- `features`: Features for detailed modeling and analysis of strong lenses (e.g. Multi Gaussian Expansion, Pixelizations).
- `likelihood_function`: A step-by-step guide of the likelihood function used to fit the dataset.

The `guides` package contains a number of important subpackages, which include:

- `results`: How to load, use and inspect the results of **lens modeling to many strong lenses** to perform scientific analysis efficiently.
- `modeling`: Ways to customize the lens modeling procedure and build advanced automated lens modeling pipelines.
- `plot`: How to plot lensing quantities and results.

The `README.md` files distributed throughout the workspace describe what is in each folder.

## Community & Support

Support for **PyAutoLens** is available via our Slack workspace, where the community shares updates, discusses
gravitational lensing analysis, and helps troubleshoot problems.

Slack is invitation-only. If you'd like to join, please send an email requesting an invite.

For installation issues, bug reports, or feature requests, please raise an issue on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoLens/issues).

## Contribution

To make changes in the tutorial notebooks, please make changes in the corresponding python files(.py) present in the
`scripts` folder of each chapter. Please note that  marker `# %%` alternates between code cells and markdown cells.

## The Lensing Regime Ladder: Galaxy, Multi-Galaxy, Group and Cluster

The `imaging`, `interferometer` and `point_source` packages provide scripts for modeling galaxy-scale lenses.
Above the single-galaxy scale, **PyAutoLens** organises lenses into a ladder of three regimes, each with its own
package. Every group and cluster is a multi-galaxy system, but not vice versa — what changes as you climb is
first the mass model, then the entire analysis strategy:

- A **galaxy-scale** lens (`imaging`, `interferometer`, `point_source`) can be modeled to high accuracy using a
  single mass distribution for the main lens galaxy. Nearby galaxies may be added as minor perturbers via the
  extra-galaxies API, but for many science cases this is not strictly necessary.

- A **multi-galaxy** lens (`multi_galaxy`) has two or more galaxies of comparable mass which all contribute
  significantly to the lensing — the notion of a single 'main' lens galaxy is ill-posed, and every co-dominant
  deflector gets its own free light and mass model. There is no shared dark-matter halo. The analysis workflow
  is unchanged from galaxy scale: one extended source, reconstructed at pixel level from the imaging.

- A **group-scale** lens (`group`) adds a dominant group-scale dark-matter halo (~10^13-10^14 solar masses) as
  an *explicit modelling choice*, with member galaxies organised into tiers (main / extra / scaling galaxies,
  the latter tied to a luminosity scaling relation — tidally truncated dPIE members in the Lenstool-convention
  workflow of `group/features/group_halo`, untruncated isothermals in the PyAutoLens-native default of
  `group/features/scaling_relation`). The source modelling is unchanged:
  one dominant extended source, fitted at pixel level.

- A **cluster-scale** lens (`cluster`) shares the group's mass framework (host halo(s) + many truncated members
  on scaling relations) but is distinguished by its **analysis strategy**: dozens of sources at different
  redshifts are fitted as point-source multiple-image positions with multi-plane ray tracing, and the lens
  galaxies' light is not modeled. Extended source reconstruction becomes a specialised follow-up of individual
  systems, not the default workflow.

## Build Configuration

The `config/` directory contains two files used by the automated build and test system
(CI, smoke tests, and pre-release checks). These are not relevant to normal workspace usage.

- `config/build/no_run.yaml` — scripts to skip during automated runs. Each entry is a filename stem
  or path pattern with an inline comment explaining why it is skipped.
- `config/build/profile_smoke.yaml` — environment variables applied to each script during automated runs.
  Defines default values (e.g. test mode, small datasets) and per-script overrides for scripts
  that need different settings.
