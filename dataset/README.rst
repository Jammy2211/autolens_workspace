The ``dataset`` folder contains lens datasets distributed with the ``autolens_workspace``.

The majority of datasets are simulated lenses, which are simulated in corresponding ``simulators`` folders throughout
the ``imaging`, ``interferometer``, ``point``, ``group`` and ``cluster`` folders.

There are a couple of real lenses also included in the ``slacs`` folder.
