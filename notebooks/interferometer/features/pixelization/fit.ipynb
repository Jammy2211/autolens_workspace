        "__Advantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "Many strongly lensed source galaxies exhibit complex, asymmetric, and irregular morphologies. Such structures\n",
        "cannot be well approximated by analytic light profiles such as a S\u00e9rsic profile, or even combinations of multiple\n",
        "S\u00e9rsic components. pixelizations are therefore required to accurately reconstruct this irregular source-plane light.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even alternative basis-function approaches, such as shapelets or multi-Gaussian expansions, struggle to accurately\n",
        "reconstruct sources with highly complex morphologies or multiple distinct source galaxies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pixelized source models are also essential for robustly constraining detailed components of the lens mass\n",
        "distribution (e.g. the mass density slope or the presence of dark matter substructure). By fitting all of the lensed\n",
        "source light, they reduce degeneracies between the source and lens mass model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, many science applications aim to study the highly magnified source galaxy itself, in order to learn about\n",
        "distant and intrinsically faint galaxies. pixelizations reconstruct the unlensed source emission, enabling detailed\n",
        "studies of the source-plane structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "For CCD imaging, a disadvantage of pixelized source reconstructions is they are the most computationally expensive\n",
        "modeling approach. However, for interferometer datasets, the way that JAX and GPUs can exploit the sparsity in the\n",
        "linear algebra means pixelized source reconstructions are both significantly faster than other approaches (E.g.\n",
        "light profiles) and can scale to millions of visibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Disadvantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "Lens modeling with pixelizations is conceptually more complex. There are additional failure modes, such as\n",
        "solutions where the source is reconstructed in a highly demagnified configuration due to an unphysical lens mass\n",
        "model (e.g. too little or too much mass). These issues are discussed in detail later in the workspace.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, learning to successfully fit lens models with pixelizations typically requires more time and experience\n",
        "than the simpler modeling approaches introduced elsewhere in the workspace.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Positive Only Solver__\n",
        "\n",
        "Many codes which use linear algebra typically rely on a linear algabra solver which allows for positive and negative\n",
        "values of the solution (e.g. `np.linalg.solve`), because they are computationally fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "This could be problematic, as it means that negative surface brightnesses values can be computed to represent a galaxy's\n",
        "light, which is clearly unphysical. For a pixelizaiton, this often produces negative source pixels which over-fit\n",
        "the data, producing unphysical solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For CCD imaging datsets pixelized source reconstructions use a positive-only solver, meaning that every source-pixel\n",
        "is only allowed to reconstruct positive flux values. This ensures that the source reconstruction is physical and\n",
        "that we don't reconstruct negative flux values that don't exist in the real source galaxy (a common systematic\n",
        "solution in lens analysis).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, for interferometer datasets this positive-only solver is often disabled, because negative pixel values\n",
        "can be observed from the measurement process. All interferometer examples therefore disable the positive only solver,\n",
        "but you may want to consider if using the positive-only solver is appropriate for your dataset."
