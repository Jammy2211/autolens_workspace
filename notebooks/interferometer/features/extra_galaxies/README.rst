The ``extra_galaxies`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis using the extra galaxies
API, which includes extra galaxies surrounding a strong lens in the lens model, modeling their light and / or mass.

Files

The following example scripts illustrating lens modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Lens modeling using a model which includes extra galaxies.
- ``simulator``: Simulating strong lens data with extra galaxies surrounding it.
- ``slam``: Using the Source, Light and Mass (SLAM) pipeline to perform lens modeling which includes extra galaxies.

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/guides/results``.
