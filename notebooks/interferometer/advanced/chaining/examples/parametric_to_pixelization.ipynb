        "====================================\n",
        "\n",
        "This script chains two searches to fit `Interferometer` data of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens with a model where:\n",
        "\n",
        " - The lens galaxy's light is omitted.\n",
        " - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear`.\n",
        " - The source galaxy's light is an `Exponential`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two searches break down as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) Model the source galaxy using a parametric `Sersic` and lens galaxy mass as an `Isothermal`.\n",
        " 2) Models the source galaxy using an `Inversion` and lens galaxy mass as an `Isothermal`.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Why Chain?__\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a number of benefits of chaining a parametric source model and `Inversion`, as opposed to fitting the\n",
        "`Inversion` in one search:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Parametric sources are computationally faster to fit. Therefore, even though the `Sersic` has more\n",
        " parameters for the search to fit than an `Inversion`, the model-fit is faster overall.\n",
        "\n",
        " - `Inversion`'s often go to unphysical solutions where the mass model goes to high / low normalization_list and the source\n",
        " is reconstructed as a demagnified version of the image. (see Chapter 4, tutorial 6 for a complete description of\n",
        " this effect). This does not occur for a parametric source, therefore the mass model can be initialized using a\n",
        " parametric source, which sets up the search which fits an `Inversion` so as to not sample these unphysical solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        " - The `auto_positions` feature can be used to further ensure these unphysical solutions do not bias the model-fit.\n",
        " Auto-positions use the maximum log likelihood mass model of the first search to determine the image-plane position of\n",
        " the lensed source. In the second search, we then require that a mass model must trace these positions within a threshold\n",
