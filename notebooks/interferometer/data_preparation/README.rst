The ``interferometer/data_preparation`` package provides gtools for preparing an interferometer 
dataset (e.g. Hubble Space Telescope) before **PyAutoLens** analysis:

Files (Beginner - SHOULD READ)
------------------------------

- ``profiling.py``: An overview of interferometer run-times and how to make your analysis run as fast as possible.
- ``casa_to_autogalaxy``: Convert a dataset to **PyAutoLens** formats via CASA.

Notes
-----

The example scripts for preparing interferometer data are still in development. If they are unclear, you should
ask to be added to the **PyAutoLens** Slack channel and ask questions there.
