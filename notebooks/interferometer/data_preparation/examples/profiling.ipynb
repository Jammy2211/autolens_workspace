        "For performing an `Inversion` to interferometer data, there are a variety of settings that can be chosen which produce\n",
        "numerically equivalent solutions but change how the calculation is performed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The run time of the `Inversion` varies considerably depending on what settings are used, and the fastest settings\n",
        "depend on the number of visibilities in the interferometer dataset as well as its `uv_wavelengths`.\n",
        "\n",
        "This script allows you to load an interferometer dataset, define the `real_space_mask` and fit it for all combinations\n",
        "of different settings to determine which settings give the fastest results for your dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "To fit the dataset a lens mass model is omitted, given we have not modeled the dataset yet. Whilst the solution we use\n",
        "is therefore not an actual strong lens model, it is appropriate for determining the fastest settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the settings will use extremely large amounts of memory (e.g. > 100GB) for large visibility datasets\n",
        "(e.g. > 100000) and may crash your computer. To prevent this, their profiling function is commented out below. However,\n",
        "these settings may give the fastest performance for low visibility datasets (e.g. < 1000). If your dataset has\n",

        " - **Matrices:** Use a numerically more accurate matrix formalism to perform the linear algebra. For datasets\n",
        " of < 100 0000 visibilities this approach is computationally feasible, and if your dataset is this small we recommend\n",
        " that you use this option because it is faster (by setting `use_linear_operators=False`. However, larger visibility\n",
        " datasets these matrices require excessive amounts of memory (> 16 GB) to store, making this approach unfeasible.\n",
        "\n",
        " - **Linear Operators (default)**: These are slightly less accurate, but do not require excessive amounts of memory to\n",
        " store the linear algebra calculations. For any dataset with > 1 million visibilities this is the only viable approach\n",
