The ``autolens_workspace/scripts`` folder contains the packages for different science use-cases, where each package
only contains Python scripts (e.g. `.py` files) illustrating how to perform a specific task.

For Jupyter Notebook examples illustrating the same use-cases, see the ``autolens_workspace/notebooks`` folder.

Refer to the ``autolens_workspace/README.rst`` file or the readthedocs documentation for a description of which folder
you should go into next if you are unsure.

Folders
-------

- ``guides``: Step-by-step guides illustrating many important things, inculding the core API, analysing modeling results and much more.
- ``imaging``: Examples for galaxy scale strong lenses observed with CCD imaging (e.g. Hubble, Euclid).
- ``interferometer``: Examples for galaxy scale strong lenses observed with an interferometer (e.g. ALMA, JVLA).
- ``point_source``: Examples for strong lens point source datasets.
- ``group``: Examples for group scale strong lenses.
- ``cluster``: Examples for cluster scale strong lenses.
- ``multi``: Examples for multiple datasets simultaneously (E.g. multi-wavelength imaging, imaging and interferometry).
- ``howtolens``: The **HowToLens** lectures which teach inexperienced scientists what strong lensing is how to use **PyAutoLens**.
