The ``modeling`` folder contains example scripts for modeling different datasets (E.g. CCD Imaging, Interferometry).

Files (Beginner)
----------------

``start_here``: Quick overview of what lens modeling is and where to go next.
``cookbook``: A cookbook illustrating how to compose models with different parameterizations and assumptions.
``searches``: The non-linear searches available in autolens, and which ones you might find useful.
``customize``: Different ways to customize the lens modeling fitting analysis.

Folders (Beginner)
