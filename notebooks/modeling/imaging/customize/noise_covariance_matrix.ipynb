        "==================================\n",

        "This example demonstrates how to account for correlated noise in a dataset, using a noise covariance matrix. This\n",

        "__Advantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "For datasets with high amounts of correlated noise, this will give a more accurate analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Disadvantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be challenging to properly measure the noise covariance matrix and for high resolution datasets\n",
        "can pose issues in terms of storing the matrix in memory.\n",

        "\n",
        "These quantities are therefore visualized using the diagonal of the `noise_covariance_matrix`.\n",
        "\n",
