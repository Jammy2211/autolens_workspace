    "=======================\n",
    "\n",
    "Over sampling is a numerical technique where the images of light profiles and galaxies are evaluated\n",
    "on a higher resolution grid than the image data to ensure the calculation is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For lensing calculations, the high magnification regions of a lensed source galaxy require especially high levels of\n",
    "over sampling to ensure the lensed images are evaluated accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why throughout the workspace the cored Sersic profile is used, instead of the regular Sersic profile which\n",
    "you may be more familiar with from the literature. In this example we will increase the over sampling level and\n",
    "therefore fit a regular Sersic profile to the data, instead of a cored Sersic profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to change the over sampling used to compute the surface brightness of every image-pixel,\n",
    "whereby a higher sub-grid resolution better oversamples the image of the light profile so as to provide a more accurate\n",
    "model of its image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit**: Higher level of over sampling provide a more accurate estimate of the surface brightness in every image-pixel.\n",
    "**Downside**: Higher levels of over sampling require longer calculations and higher memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over sampling is applied separately to the light profiles which compute the surface brightness of the lens galaxy,\n",
    "which are on a `uniform` grid, and the light profiles which compute the surface brightness of the source galaxy,\n",
    "which are on a `non-uniform` grid.\n",
