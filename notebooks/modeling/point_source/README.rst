The ``modeling`` folder contains example scripts showing how to fit a lens model to a point source dataset:

Notes
-----

These scripts show how to perform lens modeling but only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/imaging/results``.
