        "This script chains two searches to fit `Imaging` data of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens with a model where:\n",
        "\n",
        " - The lens galaxy's light is omitted.\n",
        " - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `PowerLaw`.\n",
        " - The source galaxy's light is a linear parametric `SersicCore`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two searches break down as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) Models the lens galaxy's mass as an `Isothermal` and the source galaxy's light as an `Sersic`.\n",
        " 2) Models the lens galaxy's mass an an `PowerLaw` and the source galaxy's light as an `Sersic`.\n",

        "\n",
        "The `EllPower` is a general form of the `Isothermal` which has one additional parameter, the `slope`,\n",
        "which controls the inner mass distribution as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        " - A higher slope concentrates more mass in the central regions of the mass profile relative to the outskirts.\n",
        " - A lower slope shallows the inner mass distribution reducing its density relative to the outskirts. \n",
        "\n",
        "By allowing the lens model to vary the mass profile's inner distribution, its non-linear parameter space becomes\n",
        "significantly more complex and a notable degeneracy appears between the mass model`s mass normalization, elliptical\n",
        "components and slope. This is challenging to sample in an efficient and robust manner, especially when the non-linear\n",
        "search's initial samples use broad uniform priors on the lens and source parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Search chaining allows us to begin by fitting an `Isothermal` model and therefore estimate the lens's mass\n",
        "model and the source parameters via a non-linear parameter space that does not have a strong of a parameter degeneracy\n",
        "present. This makes the model-fit more efficient and reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second search then fits the `PowerLaw`, using prior passing to initialize the mass and elliptical\n",

        "is also fixed.\n",
        "\n",
