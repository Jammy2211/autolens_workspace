        "============================\n",

        "This script chains two searches to fit `Imaging` data of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens with a model where:\n",
        "\n",
        " - The lens galaxy's light is a bulge with a linear parametric `Sersic` light profile.\n",
        " - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear`.\n",
        " - The source galaxy's light is an `Exponential`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two searches break down as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) Model the lens galaxy's light using an `Sersic` bulge. The source is present in the image, but modeling it is\n",
        "    omitted.\n",
        "      \n",
        " 2) Models the lens galaxy's mass using an `Isothermal` and source galaxy's light using\n",
        "    an `Sersic`. The lens light model is fixed to the result of search 1.\n",

        "__Why Chain?__\n",
        "\n",
        "For many strong lenses the lens galaxy's light is distinct from the source galaxy's light, and it is therefore a valid\n",
        "approach to first subtract the lens's light and then focus on fitting the lens mass model and source's light. This\n",
        "provides the following benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        " - The non-linear parameter space defined by a bulge (N=7), mass (N=5) and parametric source (N=7) models above\n",
        " has N=27 dimensions. By splitting the model-fit into two searches, we fit parameter spaces of dimensions N=7\n",
        " (bulge) and N=12 (mass+source). These are more efficient to sample and less like to infer a local maxima or\n",
        " unphysical solution.\n",
        "\n",
        " - The lens galaxy's light traces its mass, so we can use the lens light model inferred in search 1 to initialize\n",
        " sampling of the mass model`s centre. In principle we could do this for other parameters like its `elliptical_comp``s.\n",
        " However, the lens light does not perfectly trace its mass, so in this example we omit such an approach.\n",
