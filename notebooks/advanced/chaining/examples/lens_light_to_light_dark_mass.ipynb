        "This script chains two searches to fit `Imaging` data of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens with a model where:\n",
        "\n",
        " - The lens galaxy's light is a bulge with a linear parametric `Sersic` light profile.\n",
        " - The lens galaxy's stellar mass distribution is a bulge tied to the light model above.\n",
        " - The lens galaxy's dark matter mass distribution is a `NFWSph`.\n",
        " - The source galaxy's light is an `Sersic`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two searches break down as follows:\n",

        " 1) Models the lens galaxy's light using an `Sersic` bulge. The source is present in the image, but modeling it is\n",
        " omitted.\n",

        " 2) Models the lens galaxy's mass using a stellar mass distriubtion which is initialized using the bulge light\n",

        "\n",
        "For many strong lenses the lens galaxy's light is distinct from the source galaxy's light, and it is therefore a valid\n",
        "approach to first subtract the lens's light and then focus on fitting the lens mass model and source's light. This\n",
        "provides the following benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        " - The non-linear parameter space defined by a bulge (N=7), stellar and dark mass (N=5) and parametric source (N=7)\n",
        " has N=27 dimensions. By splitting the model-fit into two searches, we fit parameter spaces of dimensions N=11 and then\n",
        " N=27, with many priors initialized. These are more efficient to sample and less like to infer a local maxima or\n",
        " unphysical solution.\n",
        "\n",
        " - The lens galaxy's light traces its mass, so we can use the lens light model inferred in search 1 to initialize\n",
