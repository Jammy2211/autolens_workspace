        "=========================================\n",
        "\n",
        "This scripts gives an introduce to the Source, (lens) Light and Mass (SLaM) pipelines. These are advanced modeling\n",
        "pipelines which use many aspects of core PyAutoLens functionality to automate the modeling of strong lenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Preqrequisites__\n",
        "\n",
        "Before reading this script, you should have familiarity with the following key concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Non-linear Search Chaining:** This approach, demonstrated in `imaging/advanced/chaining`, shows the power of\n",
        "  linking models together in a sequence, such as transitioning from a light profile source to a pixelized source.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pixelizations:** These structures, explained in `features/pixelization.ipynb`, allow for the reconstruction of the\n",
        "  source galaxy on a pixel grid.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Adaptive Pixelizations:** Described in `imaging/advanced/chaining/pix_adapt/start_here.ipynb`, these pixelizations\n",
        "  adapt to the unlensed morphology of the source.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multi Gaussian Expansions (MGE):** Introduced in `features/multi_gaussian_expansion.ipynb`, MGEs are employed to\n",
        "  model the lens's light and can serve as an initialization for source galaxy light prior to using pixelization.\n",
        "\n",
        "If any of these concepts are unfamiliar, you may still proceed with the script, but reviewing the referenced examples\n",
        "later can deepen your understanding of how and why SLaM pipelines are structured as they are.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, this script allows for flexibility with model components, such as swapping out MGE models for other\n",
        "light profiles (e.g., linear `Sersic` profiles). For an example, see `examples/source_light_profile.ipynb`.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Overview__\n",
        "\n",
        "The Source, (Lens) Light, and Mass (SLaM) pipelines strategically chain together up to five sequential searches,\n",
        "carefully designed to maximize the advantages of search chaining. This setup provides a fully automated framework for\n",
        "fitting large samples of strong lenses with complex models, making SLaM the default choice for many **PyAutoLens**\n",
        "research publications.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Pipeline Structure__\n",
        "\n",
        "Each pipeline in the SLaM sequence targets a specific aspect of the strong lens model:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Source Pipeline**: The first step focuses on establishing a robust source model. For pixelized sources,\n",
        "  this includes obtaining accurate values for mesh and regularization parameters. For sources modeled with light\n",
        "  profiles, the focus is on determining initial parameter estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Light Pipeline**: This stage focuses on modeling the lens light, using source and mass models fixed from previous pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mass Pipeline**: The final stage develops a detailed mass model, potentially of high complexity, leveraging source\n",
        "  and lens light models initialized from earlier stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Models set up in earlier pipelines guide those used in later ones. For instance, if the Source Pipeline uses a\n",
        "pixelized `Delaunay` mesh for the source, that mesh type will carry through to the Mass Total Pipeline that follows.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Design Choices__\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many design choices that go into the SLaM pipelines, which we discuss now.\n",
        "\n",
        "The SLaM pipelines are designed around pixelixed source modeling. Pixelized sources are necessary for fitting complex\n",
        "mass models, which the SLaM pipelines automates the fitting of. However, the SLaM pipelines support fitting of\n",
        "light profile sources, and using the SLaM pipelines in this way will still provide automated and robust lens modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "We now list the design considerations which dictate the ordering of the SLaM pipelines, which were driven by the use\n",
        "of pixelized source modeling:\n",
        "\n",
        "The SLaM pipelines involve several design choices to support the complexities of pixelized source modeling, which is\n",
        "crucial for robustly fitting complex mass models. Here\u2019s an overview of these key considerations and their influence\n",
        "on the pipeline sequence:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Source First**: The pipeline starts with the Source Pipeline, as complex mass models (e.g., `PowerLaw` or\n",
        "composite models with stars and dark matter) require pixelized source modeling rather than simple light profiles.\n",
        "This step establishes a robust pixelized source model using a simpler mass model (like `Isothermal` with `Shear`).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Image Positions**: For pixelized source modeling, specifying the positions of the multiple images of the\n",
        "lensed source(s) is crucial to prevent unphysical reconstructions. The SLaM pipelines can estimate these positions\n",
        "automatically from the SOURCE LP PIPELINE's mass and source results.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Adapt Images**: Advanced pixelized source models use \"adapt images\" to optimize the mesh and regularization\n",
        "  weights according to the source's morphology. The SLaM pipelines set the adapt-images once a good model for the source is\n",
        "  available, enabling the best adaptation to the source structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Lens Light Before Mass**: Modeling the lens light accurately requires deblending the lens and source emissions,\n",
        "  which a robust pixelized source model facilitates. This deblending, essential for certain mass models with both\n",
        "  stellar and dark matter components, benefits from a simpler mass model during the lens light fitting stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mass Model Last**: The most complex mass model fitting is saved for last. This final stage benefits from the\n",
        "  prior refinement of the source and lens light models, ensuring accurate reconstructions and parameter estimations.\n",
        "\n",
        "These design choices enable the SLaM pipelines to deliver precise and automated lens modeling while optimizing each\n",
        "stage for robustness and efficiency.\n",
