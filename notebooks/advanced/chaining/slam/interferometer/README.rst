The ``slam`` folder contains examples scripts illustrating the Source, Light and mass (SLaM) pipelines.

You should read the example ``autolens_workspace/imaging/advanced/chaining/slam/start_here.ipynb`` first, which
describes the SLaM pipelines using imaging data.

These examples make it straight forward to apply SLaM to interferometer data.
