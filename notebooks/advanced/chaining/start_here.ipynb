        " 2) The mean of the `GaussianPrior` is the median PDF value of the parameter estimated in search 1.\n",

        " correspond to the `correct` regions of parameter space.\n",

        " `width_modifer` field (check these files out now).\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea here is simple. We want a value of sigma that gives a `GaussianPrior` wide enough to search a broad \n",

        "\n",
        " 1) Absolute: In this case, the error assumed on the parameter is the value given in the config file. \n",
        " For example, if for the width on centre_0 of a light profile, the width modifier reads \"Absolute\" with a value \n",
        " 0.05. This means if the error on the parameter centre_0 was less than 0.05 in the previous search, the sigma of \n",
        " its `GaussianPrior` in this search will be 0.05.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2) Relative: In this case, the error assumed on the parameter is the % of the value of the estimated value given in \n",
        " the config file. For example, if the intensity estimated in the previous search was 2.0, and the relative error in \n",
        " the config file reads \"Relative\" with a value 0.5, then the sigma of the `GaussianPrior` will be 50% of this \n",
        " value, i.e. sigma = 0.5 * 2.0 = 1.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use absolute and relative values for different parameters, depending on their properties. For example, using the \n",
        "relative value of a parameter like the `Profile` centre makes no sense. If our lens galaxy is centred at (0.0, 0.0), \n",
        "the relative error will always be tiny and thus poorly defined. Therefore, the default configs in **PyAutoLens** use \n",

        "the relative value from a previous search.\n",
