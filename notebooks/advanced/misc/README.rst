The ``misc`` folder contains miscellaneous example scripts which use **PyAutoLens** functionality that does not belong
elsewhere in the workspace.

Folders

- ``hpc``: How to set up **PyAutoLens** on high performance computers.
- ``model_quantity``: Directly fitting a lens model to a lens model quantity (e.g. the deflection angles, convergence) as opposed to using data.
