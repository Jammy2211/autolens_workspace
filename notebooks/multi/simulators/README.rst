The ``simulators`` folder contains example scripts for simulating multiple imaging datasets (E.g. multi-wavelength
Hubble Space Telescope).

Notes
-----

The ``multi`` extends the ``imaging`` package and readers should refer to the ``imaging`` package for descriptions of
how to simulate a wider variety of strong lenses.

Files (Beginner)
----------------

- ``start_here.py``: A simple example illustrating how to simulate multiple CCD imaging datasets of a galaxy scale lens.

Folders (Beginner)
------------------

These beginner folders provide examples scripts for simulating CCD imaging of galaxy scale strong lenses where:

- ``examples``: There are examples with different lens light profiles, mass distributions and source morphologies
