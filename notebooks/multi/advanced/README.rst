The ``multi`` folder contains example scripts for analysing multiple datasets simultaneously (E.g. multi-wavelength
Hubble Space Telescope imaging).

Fitting multiple datasets is an advanced **PyAutoLens** feature and we recommend users have experience fitting
individual datasets via the ``imaging`` package first.

Folders (Advanced)
------------------

- ``chaining``: Using non-linear search chaining to fit complex lens models to multiple imaging datasets.
- ``graphical``: Fitting graphical models to multiple imaging strong lens datasets simultaneously.
