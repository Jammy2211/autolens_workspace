The ``multi/results`` folder contains example scripts for using the results of a **PyAutoLens** multi-dataset
model-fit.

Specific scripts for multi-dataset results are not included in this folder, and will be written in the future.
The API for inspecting the results of most quantities (e.g. the non-linear samples or inspecting the tracer) is the
same irrespective of the dataset fitted.

Therefore, please refer to the folder `autolens_workspace/*/imaging/results/examples` for example scripts, which can
be copy and pasted into scripts which model interferometer data.

This package does include an example result, which is the result of a fit to the interferometer dataset.
