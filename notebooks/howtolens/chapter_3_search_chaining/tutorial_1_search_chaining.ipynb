        "===========================\n",
        "\n",
        "In chapter 2, we learnt how to perform lens modeling using a non-linear search. In all of the tutorials, we fitted the\n",
        "data using just one non-linear search. In this chapter, we introduce a technique called 'non-linear search chaining',\n",
        "fits a lens model using a sequence of non-linear searches. The initial searches fit simpler lens models whose parameter\n",
        "spaces can be more accurately and efficiently sampled. The results of this search are then passed to later searches\n",
        "which fit lens models of gradually increasing complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lets think back to tutorial 4 of chapter 2. We learnt there were three approaches one could take fitting a lens model\n",
        "accurately if we found that a model fit failed. These were:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) Tuning our priors to the strong lens we're fitting.\n",
        " 2) Making our lens model less complex.\n",
        " 3) Searching non-linear parameter space for longer.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, each of the above approaches has disadvantages. The more we tune our priors, the less we can generalize our\n",
        "analysis to a different strong lens. The less complex we make our model, the less realistic it is. And if we rely too\n",
        "much on searching parameter space for longer, we could end up with search`s that take days, weeks or months to run.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we are going to show how search chaining combines these 3 approaches such that we can fit\n",
        "complex and realistic lens models in a way that that can be generalized to many different strong lenses. To do this,\n",
        "we'll run 2 searches, and chain the lens model inferred in the first search to the priors of the second search`s lens\n",
        "model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our first search will make the same light-traces-mass assumption we made in the previous tutorial. We saw that this\n",
        "gives a reasonable lens model. However, we'll make a couple of extra simplifying assumptions, to really try and bring\n",
        "our lens model complexity down and get the non-linear search running fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model we infer above will therefore be a lot less realistic. But it does not matter, because in the second search\n",
        "we are going to relax these assumptions and fit the more realistic lens model. The beauty is that, by running the first\n",
        "search, we can use its results to tune the priors of our second search. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) The first search should give us a pretty good idea of the lens galaxy's light and mass profiles, for example its\n",
        " intensity, effective radius and einstein radius.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2) It should also give us a pretty good fit to the lensed source galaxy. This means we'll already know where in\n",
        " source-plane its is located and what its intensity and effective are."
