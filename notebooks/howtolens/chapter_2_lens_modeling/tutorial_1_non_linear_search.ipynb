        "In mathematics, a function is defined by its parameters, which map inputs to outputs. For example, consider the simple function:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[\n",
        "f(x) = x^2\n",
        "\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, \\(x\\) is the input parameter, and \\(f(x)\\) returns the output \\(x^2\\). This relationship defines\n",
        "the \"parameter space\" of the function, which in this case forms a parabola.\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions can also have multiple parameters, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[\n",
        "f(x, y, z) = x + y^2 - z^3\n",
        "\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "This defines a parameter space in three dimensions, representing the relationships between \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\),\n",
        "and the output \\(f(x, y, z)\\).\n",
        "\n",
        "This concept of parameter space is closely related to how we approach model-fitting. For instance, in chapter 1, w\n",
        "e created instances of `Galaxy` objects with\n",
        "parameters like \\( (\\text{`centre_0`}, \\text{`centre_1`}, \\text{`ell_comps_0`}, \\text{`ell_comps_1`}, \\text{`intensity`}, \\text{`effective_radius`}, \\text{`sersic_index`}) \\).\n",
        "These parameters were used to fit data and compute a log likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can think of this process as analogous to the function \\(f(\\( (\\text{`centre_0`}, \\text{`centre_1`}, \\text{`ell_comps_0`}, \\text{`ell_comps_1`}, \\text{`intensity`}, \\text{`effective_radius`}, \\text{`sersic_index`}) \\))\\),\n",
        "where the output is the log likelihood. This function, which maps parameter values to a log likelihood, is known\n",
        "as the \"likelihood function\" in statistical inference. To be explicit, we\u2019ll refer to it as the `log_likelihood_function`\n",
        "since it deals with the log of the likelihood function.\n",
        "\n",
        "By framing the likelihood this way, we can think of our model as having its own parameter space\u2014a multidimensional\n",
        "surface defined by all possible values of the\n",
        "parameters \\( (\\text{`centre_0`}, \\text{`centre_1`}, \\text{`ell_comps_0`}, \\text{`ell_comps_1`}, \\text{`intensity`}, \\text{`effective_radius`}, \\text{`sersic_index`}) \\).\n",
        "This surface, known as the \"likelihood surface,\" represents how the log likelihood changes across different parameter\n",
        "values. During model-fitting, our goal is to find the peak of this surface, where the fit to the data is optimal.\n",
        "\n",
        "This parameter space is \"non-linear,\" meaning the relationship between the model parameters and the log likelihood is\n",
        "not a simple linear one. Because of this non-linearity, we cannot predict the log likelihood from a given set of model\n",
        "parameters without actually performing a fit to the data, as we did in tutorial 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Non-Linear Search__\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we understand our problem in terms of a non-linear parameter space with a likelihood surface, we can\n",
        "introduce the method used to fit the model to the data \u2014- the \"non-linear search\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Previously, our approach involved manually guessing models until finding one with a good fit and high log likelihood.\n",
        "Surprisingly, this random guessing forms the basis of how model-fitting using a non-linear search actually works!\n",
        "\n",
        "A non-linear search involves systematically guessing many models while tracking their log likelihoods. As the\n",
        "algorithm progresses, it tends to favor models with parameter combinations that have previously yielded higher\n",
        "log likelihoods. This iterative refinement helps to efficiently explore the vast parameter space.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two key differences between guessing random models and using a non-linear search:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Computational Efficiency**: The non-linear search can evaluate the log likelihood of a model parameter\n",
        "  combinations in milliseconds and therefore many thousands of models in minutes. This computational speed enables\n",
        "  it to thoroughly sample potential solutions, which would be impractical for a human.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Effective Sampling**: The search algorithm maintains a robust memory of previously guessed models and their log\n",
        "  likelihoods. This allows it to sample potential solutions more thoroughly and converge on the highest\n",
        "  likelihood solutions more efficiently, which is again impractical for a human.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of the non-linear search as systematically exploring parameter space to pinpoint regions with the highest log\n",
        "likelihood values. Its primary goal is to identify and converge on the parameter values that best describe the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Search Types__\n",
        "\n",
        "There are different types of non-linear searches, each of which explores parameter space in a unique way.\n",
        "In this example, we will use three types of searches, which broadly represent the various approaches to non-linear\n",
        "searches used in statistical inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: This method aims to find the model that maximizes the likelihood function.\n",
        "  It does so by testing nearby models and adjusting parameters in the direction that increases the likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**: This approach uses a group of \"walkers\" that explore parameter space randomly.\n",
        "  The likelihood at each walker's position influences the probability of the walker moving to a new position.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Nested Sampling**: This technique samples points from the parameter space iteratively. Lower likelihood points\n",
        "  are replaced by higher likelihood ones, gradually concentrating the samples in regions of high likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will provide more details on each of these searches below.\n",

        "3. **Likelihood Surface**: This surface represents how the likelihood of the model varies across the parameter space. \n",

        "combination of parameter values that best describe the data. It iteratively adjusts the parameters to maximize the \n",
        "likelihood. Many different search algorithms exist, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and this tutorial\n",
        "used the MLE, MCMC, and nested sampling searches.\n",

        "5. **Priors**: Priors are probabilities assigned to different values of parameters before considering the data. \n",
