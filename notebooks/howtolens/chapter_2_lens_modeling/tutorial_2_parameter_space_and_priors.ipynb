        "======================================\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous tutorial, we used a non-linear search to infer the a lens model that provided a good fit to simulated\n",
        "imaging data of a strong lens. Now, we will gain deeper intuition of how a non-linear search works.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, lets develop the concept of a 'parameter space'.\n",
        "\n",
        "If mathematics, you will have learnt that we can write a simple function as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$f(x) = x^2$\n",
        "\n",
        "In this function, when we input the parameter $x`$ in to the function $f$, it returns a value $f(x)$. The mappings\n",
        "between values of $x$ and $f(x)$ define what we can call the parameter space of this function (and if you remember\n",
        "your math classes, this parameter space is defined by a parabola).\n",
        "\n",
        "A function can of course have multiple parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "$f(x, y, z) = x + y^2 - z^3$\n",
        "\n",
        "This function has 3 parameters, $x$, $y$ and $z$. The mappings between $x$, $y$ and $z$ and $f(x, y, z)$ define another\n",
        "parameter space, albeit this parameter space now has 3 dimensions. Nevertheless, just like we could plot a parabola to\n",
        "visualize the parameter space $f(x) = x^2$, we could visualize this parameter space as 3 dimensional surface.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous tutorial, we discussed how the `AnalysisImaging` class had a `log_likelihood_function` which fitted\n",
        "the imaging data with a lens model so as to return a log likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process can be thought of as us computing a likelihood from a function, just like our functions $f(x)$ above.\n",
        "However, the log likelihood function is not something that we can write down analytically as an equation and its\n",
        "behaviour is inherently non-linear. Nevertheless, it is a function, and if we put the same values of a model\n",
        "parameters into this function the same value of log likelihood will be returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, we can write our log likelihood function as follows, using terms such as $I_{lp}$, $x_{mp}$, $y_{mp}$,\n",
        "as short-hand notation for the parameters of our light profiles and mass profiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "$f(I_{lp}, x_{mp},, y_{mp}, ...) = log(likelihood)$\n",
        "\n",
        "By expressing the likelihood in this way we now have a parameter space! The solutions to this function cannot be written\n",
        "analytically and it is highly complex and non-linear. However, we have already learnt how we use this function to\n",
        "find solutions which give the highest likelihoods; we use a non-linear search!\n",
        "\n",
        "To gain further insight, we can inspect the results of the previous tutorial and its 'Probability density functions' or\n",
        "`PDF' for short. These provide a visual representation of where the non-linear search found the highest likelihood\n",
        "regions of parameter space for each parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Navigate to the folder `autolens_workspace/output/howtolens/tutorial_1_non_linear_search/images/searches`\n",
        "and open the `cornerplot.png` figure, where:\n",
        "\n",
        " - The 1D plots of curved lines show, in one dimension, the values of each parameter that gave the highest likelihood\n",
        " solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        " - The 2D plots show contours of how different combinations of parameters gave the highest likelihood. When we see\n",
        "  a curved contour between two parameters, we say that they are 'degenerate', whereby changing both parameters in a\n",
        "  systematic way leads to models that fit the data equally well. As example degeneracy is between the source's\n",
        "  intensity $I_{lp}$ and effective radius $R_{lp}$, which makes sense: making the source galaxy brighter and smaller is\n",
        "  similar to making it fainter and bigger!\n",
        "\n",
        "So, how does a non-linear search know where to search parameter space? A parameter, say, the Einstein Radius, could in\n",
        "principle take any value between negative and positive infinity. Something must be telling it to only search certain\n",
        "regions of parameter space with `reasonable` physically plausible values of Einstein radius (between 1.0\"-4.0\").\n",
        "\n",
        "These are called the 'priors'. Our priors define where we instruct the non-linear search to search parameter space, and\n",
        "throughout these tutorials we will use three types of prior:\n",
        "\n",
        "- UniformPrior: The values of a parameter are randomly drawn between a `lower_limit` and `upper_limit`. For example,\n",
        "the Einstein radius of an isothermal mass profiles typically assumes a uniform prior between 0.0\" and 4.0\".\n",
        "\n",
        "- LogUniformPrior: Like a `UniformPrior` this randomly draws values between a `limit_limit` and `upper_limit`, but the\n",
        "values are drawn from a distribution with base 10. This is used for the `intensity` of a light profile, as the\n",
        "luminosity of galaxies follows a log10 distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- GaussianPrior: The values of a parameter are randomly drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a `mean` and width\n",
        " `sigma`. For example, the $y$ and $x$ centre values in a light or mass profile typically assume a mean of 0.0\" and a\n",
        " sigma of 0.3\", indicating that we expect the profile centre to be located near the centre of the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "The default priors of every parameter are provided in the configuration files located at\n",
        "`autolens_workspace/config/priors/`. Each class of models has a config file (e.g. `light_profiles.json`) and they\n",
