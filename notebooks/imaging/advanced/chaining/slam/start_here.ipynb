        "\n",
        "This scripts gives an introduce to the Source, (lens) Light and Mass (SLaM) pipelines. These are advanced modeling\n",
        "pipelines which use many aspects of core PyAutoLens functionality to automate the modeling of strong lenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Prequisites__\n",
        "\n",
        "Before reading this script, you should be familiar with non-linear search chaining, illustrated in the\n",
        "`imaging/advanced/chaining` package, and have experience using have looked at multiple examples explaining why its\n",
        "a powerful tool to chain models together (e.g. going from a light profile source to pixelixed source).\n",
        "\n",
        "You should also be familiar with adaptive pixelization features, which are described in the\n",
        "`imaging/advanced/chaining/pix_adapt/start_here.py` script. These features adapt the source pixelization to the source's\n",

        "__Overview__\n",
        "\n",
        "The Source, (lens) Light and Mass pipelines (SLaM) chain together between 3-6 searches in a carefully crafted way\n",
        "which fully exploit the different benefits of search chaining. They provide a fully automated framework for fitting\n",
        "large samples of strong lenses with complex strong lens models. They are the default pipelines used by many PyAutoLens\n",
        "scientific publications.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Pipeline Structure__\n",
        "\n",
        "Each pipeline that makes up the overall SLaM pipelines focuses on a specific aspect of the strong lens model: \n",
        "\n",
        " - Source: The first pipeline(s) infer a robust source model. For pixelized sources, this means robust values for the\n",
        "   mesh and regularization. For light profile sources, this means estimates of its initial parameters.\n",
        "   \n",
        " - Light: The next pipeline infers the lens light, using fixed source and mass models from the previous pipeline(s).\n",
        "   \n",
        " - Mass: The final pipeline infers a mass model of any complexity, using source and lens light models initialized\n",
        "   from the previous pipeline(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "The models fitted in earlier pipelines determine the models used in later pipelines. For example, if the SOURCE\n",
        "PIPELINE uses a pixelized `Voronoi` mesh for the source, this will be used in the subsequent MASS TOTAL PIPELINE.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Design Choices__\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many design choices that go into the SLaM pipelines, which we discuss now.\n",
        "\n",
        "The SLaM pipelines are designed around pixelixed source modeling. Pixelized sources are necessary for fitting complex\n",
        "mass models, which the SLaM pipelines automates the fitting of. However, the SLaM pipelines support fitting of\n",
        "light profile sources, and using the SLaM pipelines in this way will still provide automated and robust lens modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "We now list the design considerations which dictate the ordering of the SLaM pipelines, which were driven by the use\n",
        "of pixelized source modeling:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Starting With the Source: The SLaM pipelines begin with the Source Pipeline because complex mass models (w.g. a\n",
        "   `PowerLaw` or stars plus dark matter model) cannot be fitted accurately using a light profiles for the source. A\n",
        "   robust pixelized source model (e.g. the mesh and regularization) can be set up using a simpler mass\n",
        "   model (e.g. `Isothermal` plus `Shear`).\n",
        "\n",
        " - Positions: Pixelized source modeling requires the positions of the multiple images of the lensed source(s) to be\n",
        "   input into the analysis, to prevent unphysical pixelized source reconstructions. The SLaM pipelines can determine\n",
        "   these positions automatically, using the mass and source model of the results of the SOURCE LP PIPELINE. However,\n",
        "   WE RECOMMEND users still input positions manually, as this provides a more robust analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Adapt Images: Advanced pixelized source models use \"adapt images\" to adapt the mesh and regularization weights to\n",
        "   the source's morphology. This functionality is discussed in `advanced/chaining/pix_adapt`. The SLaM pipelines\n",
        "   gradually improve the lens model and therefore gradually improve these adapt images, ensuring this adaptive\n",
        "   functionality can produce the best adaptation to the source's properties.\n",
        "   \n",
        " - Lens Light Before Mass: Fitting complex lens light models requires clean deblending of the lens and lensed source\n",
        "   emission. This requires a robust pixelized source model, which simultaneously reconstructs the source light when\n",
        "   fitting the lens light. This deblending can be performed accurate using a simpler mass model. Therefore, the SLaM\n",
        "   pipelines refine the lens light before fitting a complex mass model. Certain mass models fit stars plus dark\n",
        "   models and therefore require this very accurate lens light model to be inferred first.\n",
        "   \n",
        " - Mass Last: The SLaM pipelines fit the most complex mass models last. This is because they require the most accurate\n",
        "   pixelized source model possible, and the most accurate lens light model possible.\n",
        "\n",
