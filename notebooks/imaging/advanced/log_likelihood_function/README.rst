The ``log_likelihood_function`` folder contains example scripts showing step-by-step visual guides to how likelihoods
are evaluated in **PyAutoLens**.

Files (Beginner)
----------------

- ``parametric.py``: The likelihood function of a parametric source fit, which uses an elliptical Sersic to represent the source.
- ``pixelized.py``: The likelihood function of a pixelized source reconstruction, which uses a regularized pixelization to reconstruct the source.
- ``features.py``: Explains addition inputs which adjust the behaviour of the likelihood functions above.
- ``contributor_guide.py``: URL links to every package, module and function called to perform likelihood evaluations for contributors.
