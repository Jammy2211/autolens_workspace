The ``linear_light_profiles`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis using linear light profiles.

Files
-----

The following example scripts illustrating lens modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Lens modeling using linear light profiles.
- ``fit``: Fit linear light profiles and compute quantities like the residuals, chi squared and likelihood.
- ``likelihood_function``: A step-by-step guide of the linear light profile likelihood function.

Results
-------

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/guides/results``.
