        "Modeling Features: Linear Light Profiles\n",
        "========================================\n",
        "\n",
        "A \"linear light profile\" is a variant of a standard light profile where the `intensity` parameter is solved for\n",
        "via linear algebra every time the model is fitted to the data. This uses a process called an \"inversion\" and it\n",
        "always computes the `intensity` values that give the best fit to the data (e.g. maximize the likelihood)\n",
        "given the light profile's other parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the advantages below, we recommended you always use linear light profiles to fit models over standard\n",
        "light profiles!\n",
        "\n",
        "__Contents__\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages & Disadvatanges:** Benefits and drawbacks of linear light profiles.\n",
        "**Positive Only Solver:** How a positive solution to the light profile intensities is ensured.\n",
        "**Dataset & Mask:** Standard set up of imaging dataset that is fitted.\n",
        "**Fit:** Perform a fit to a dataset using linear light profile with inputs for other light profile parameters.\n",
        "**Intensities:** Access the solved for intensities of light profiles from the fit.\n",
        "**Visualization:** Plotting images of model-fits using linear light profiles.\n",
        "**Linear Objects (Source Code)**: Internal source code implementation of linear light profiles (for contributors).\n",
        "\n",
        "__Advantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "Each light profile's `intensity` parameter is therefore not a free parameter in the model-fit, reducing the\n",
        "dimensionality of non-linear parameter space by the number of light profiles (in this example by 2 dimensions).\n",
        "\n",
        "This also removes the degeneracies that occur between the `intensity` and other light profile parameters\n",
        "(e.g. `effective_radius`, `sersic_index`), which are difficult degeneracies for the non-linear search to map out\n",
        "accurately. This produces more reliable lens model results and the fit converges in fewer iterations, speeding up the\n",
        "overall analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The inversion has a relatively small computational cost, thus we reduce the model complexity without much slow-down and\n",
        "can therefore fit models more reliably and faster!\n",
        "\n",
        "__Disadvantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "Althought the computation time of the inversion is small, it is not non-negligable. It is approximately 3-4x slower\n",
        "than using a standard light profile.\n",
        "\n",
        "The gains in run times due to the simpler non-linear parameter space therefore are somewhat balanced by the slower\n",
        "likelihood calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Positive Only Solver__\n",
        "\n",
        "Many codes which use linear algebra typically rely on a linear algabra solver which allows for positive and negative\n",
        "values of the solution (e.g. `np.linalg.solve`), because they are computationally fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is problematic, as it means that negative surface brightnesses values can be computed to represent a galaxy's\n",
        "light, which is clearly unphysical.\n",
        "\n",
        "**PyAutoLens** uses a positive only linear algebra solver which has been extensively optimized to ensure it is as fast\n",
        "as positive-negative solvers. This ensures that all light profile intensities are positive and therefore physical.\n",
