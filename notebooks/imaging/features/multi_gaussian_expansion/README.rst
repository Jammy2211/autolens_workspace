The ``multi_gaussian_expansion`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis using a Multi Gaussian Expansion (MGE).

Files
-----

The following example scripts illustrating lens modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Lens modeling using an MGE.
- ``simulator``: Simulating strong lens data with complexity in its light which requires an MGE to capture accurately.
- ``fit``: Fit an MGE and compute quantities like the residuals, chi squared and likelihood.
- ``likelihood_function``: A step-by-step guide of the MGE likelihood function.
- ``slam``: Using the Source, Light and Mass (SLAM) pipeline to perform lens modeling using a MGE.

Results

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/guides/results``.
