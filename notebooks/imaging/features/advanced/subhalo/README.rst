The ``subhalo`` folder contains example scripts for strong lens dark matter subhalo
analysis (detection and sensitivity mapping).

This is an advanced feature and assumes users are familiar with the Source, Light and Mass (SLaM) pipelines, which
are extended in order to perform dark matter subhalo analysis.
