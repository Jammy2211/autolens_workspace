The ``imaging`` folder contains example scripts showing how to analyse galaxy-scale strong lenses with
CCD imaging data (E.g. Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope)

Results
-------

The ``modeling`` example performs lens modeling but only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the
results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/results``.
