        "\n",
        "Each pipeline targets a specific part of the lens model:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Source Pipeline**:\n",
        "   Builds a reliable model of the source galaxy. For pixelized sources, this includes determining\n",
        "   stable mesh and regularization parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Light Pipeline**:\n",
        "   Models the lens galaxy\u2019s light using the fixed source model from step 1. Accurate subtraction\n",
        "   of lens light is essential for robust mass modeling.\n",

        "3. **Mass Pipeline**:\n",
        "   Fits the lens mass distribution (often complex), using the refined source and lens-light models\n",
        "   from previous pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The SLaM workflow is flexible\u2014you can swap MGE light profiles for other light models if desired. Models set up in\n",
        "earlier pipelines guide those used in later ones. For example, if the Source Pipeline uses a `RectangularAdaptDensity`\n",

        "__Design Choices__\n",
        "\n",
        "The structure of the SLaM pipelines is driven by the requirements of **adaptive pixelized source modeling**,\n",
        "which is essential for fitting complex light and mass distributions for the lens.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although SLaM also supports light-profile sources, pixelized sources are at the core of the pipeline design and\n",

        "- **Source First**\n",
        "  Complex mass models (e.g., `PowerLaw`, or composite stellar + dark matter models) require pixelized\n",
        "  source reconstruction, not simple light profiles. Therefore, SLaM begins with a source model using a\n",
        "  simpler mass profile (e.g., `Isothermal` + `ExternalShear`) to provide a stable basis for later stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Image Positions**\n",
        "  Pixelized modeling needs robust multiple image-position estimates to prevent unphysical source reconstructions.\n",
        "  SLaM automatically determines these positions from the results of the Source Light Profile Pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Adapt Images**\n",
        "  Advanced pixelizations use lens-light-subtracted \u201cadapt images\u201d to adapt the source pixelization mesh and\n",
        "  regularization to the unlensed source morphology. These are only set once a sufficiently accurate source model\n",
        "  is available from earlier stages in the Source Pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Lens Light Before Mass**\n",
        "  Accurate lens-light subtraction is required before fitting complex mass models, especially for mass models\n",
        "  fitting stellar and dark matter components simultanoeusly. Pixelized source modeling enables reliable\n",
        "  deblending of the lens and source, so the lens light model is refined after the adaptive pixelized source is\n",
        "  accuratel but before fitting more complex mass models.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mass Model Last**\n",
        "  The most flexible and complex mass models are fit only after high-quality source and lens-light models\n",
        "  are established, ensuring stable priors and accurate mass inference.\n",
