The ``plot` folder contains scripts which show how to use built-in visualization tools.

The API provides a simple interface with matplotlib for making plots that does not require the user to
write any matplotlib code themselves.

This is illustrated in the ``start_here`` / ``start_here.ipynb`` file, where new users should begin.
