Files
-----

The following files in the ``guides`` folder are important, providing a full overview of the core API fundamental to
most calculations.

- ``data_structures``: How the NumPy arrays containing results are structured and the API for using them.
- ``tracer`` Performing ray-tracing and lensing calculations.
- ``galaxies`` Creating and using galaxies and their mass and light profiles.

Folders
-------

- ``results``: How to use the results of a **PyAutoLens** model-fit (includes the ``database``).
