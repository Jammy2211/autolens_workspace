The ``plot` folder contains scripts which show how to use **PyAutoLens** built-in visualization tools.

The **PyAutoLens** API provides a simple interface with matplotlib for making plots that does not require the user to
write any matplotlib code themselves.

This is illustrate in the ``start_here.py`` / ``start_here.ipynb`` file, which I strongly recommend new users read!

Files (Beginner)
----------------

- ``start_here.py``: An introduction to plotting and visualization (RECOMMENDED READ).

Folders (Beginner)
------------------

- ``mat_wrap``: Objects which wrap Matplotlib functions which customize a figure's appearance.
- ``multi``: Plotting multiple subplots or lines on 1D figures.
- ``plots``: Output plots written to hard-disk.
- ``plotters``: Plotters which plot specific **PyAutoLens** objects (e.g. ``GalaxyPlotter``, ``TracerPlotter``).
- ``publication``: Examples for plotting figures suitable for published scientific papers.
- ``search``: Visualization tools for the results of a non-linear search (e.g. ``DynestyPlotter``).
- ``visuals_1d``: Include 1D visuals on a 1D plot (e.g. a vertical line of the Einstein on a 1D convergence plot).
- ``visuals_2d``: Include 2D visuals on a 2D plot (e.g. a critical curve on an image).
