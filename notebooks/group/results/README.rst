The ``group/results`` folder contains example scripts for using the results of a **PyAutoLens** point source
model-fit.

Specific scripts for point source results  are not included in this folder, and will be written in the future.
The API for inspecting the results of most quantities (e.g. the non-linar samples or inspecting the tracer) is the
same irrespective of the dataset fitted.

Therefore, please refer to the folder `autolens_workspace/*/imaging/results/examples` for example scripts, which can
be copy and pasted into scripts which model interferometer data.

This package does include an example result, which is the result of a fit to the interferometer dataset.
