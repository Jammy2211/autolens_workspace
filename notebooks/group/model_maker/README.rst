The ``model_maker`` folder contains example scripts for creating lens models of group scale strong lenses.

For group-scaler strong lens modeling, there are multiple lens and / or source galaxies. Manually writing the lens
model of each in the Python scripts we used to perform lens model becomes unfeasible and it better for us to manage
model composition in a separate file and store them in .json files.
