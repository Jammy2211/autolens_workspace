The ``cluster`` folder contains example scripts showing how to analyse cluster scale strong lenses,
which are lenses where 10-100+ galaxies are responsible for the lensing of 3-50+ sources.

IN DEVELOPMENT
--------------

Cluster strong lensing is an **IN DEVELOPMENT** feature with the examples in this folder incomplete and
subject to change. They are here so that experienced users can begin to explore cluster lensing
capabilities early, but new users and inexperience lens modelers may struggle to use them.

Start Here
----------

New users should read the ``start_here`` example, which gives an overview of all examples in the folder.

Files
-----

- ``start_here``: A simple example illustrating how to to analyse cluster scale strong lenses.
- ``modeling``: Detailed example of performing lens modeling of a cluster scale strong lens using the multiple image locations.
- ``simulator``: Detailed example of how to simulate a cluster scale strong lens.
- ``data_preparation``: How to prepare data for cluster scale lens modeling, including marking the multiple image positions and lens galaxy centres.

Folders
-------

- ``features``: Examples illustrating different core features for cluster scale analysis and lens modeling.

Results
-------

The ``modeling`` example performs lens modeling but only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the
results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/guides/results``.
