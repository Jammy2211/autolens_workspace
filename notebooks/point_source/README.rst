The ``point_source`` folder contains example scripts showing how to analyse galaxy-scale strong lenses with
point source lensing data (E.g. lensed quasars, lensed supernovae)

----------

New users should read the ``start_here`` example, which gives an overview of all examples in the folder.

Files
-----

- ``start_here``: A simple example illustrating how to analyse point source lensing data.
- ``modeling``: Detailed example of performing lens modeling of point source lensing data.
- ``simulator``: Detailed example of how to simulate strong lens point source lensing data.
- ``simulator_sample``: How to simulate a sample of strong lenses point source observations.

Folders
-------

- ``features``: Examples illustrating different core features for point source lensing analysis and lens modeling.

Results
-------

The ``modeling`` example performs lens modeling but only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the
results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/guides/results``.
