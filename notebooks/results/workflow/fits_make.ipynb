    "Results: Fits Make\n",
    "==================\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is a results workflow example, which means it provides tool to set up an effective workflow inspecting\n",
    "and interpreting the large libraries of modeling results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use the aggregator to load .fits files output by a model-fit, extract hdu images and create\n",
    "new .fits files, for example all to a single folder on your hard-disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a common use case is extracting an image from `model_galaxy_images.fits` of many fits and putting them\n",
    "into a single .fits file on your hard-disk. If you have modeled 100+ datasets, you can then inspect all model images\n",
    "in DS9 in .fits format n a single folder, which is more efficient than clicking throughout the `output` open each\n",
    ".fits file one-by-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of .fits splciing is where multiple observations of the same galaxy are analysed, for example\n",
    "at different wavelengths, where each fit outputs a different .fits files. The model images of each fit to each\n",
    "wavelength can then be packaged up into a single .fits file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables the results of many model-fits to be concisely visualized and inspected, which can also be easily passed\n",
    "on to other collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, splicing uses standard Astorpy functions to open, edit and save .fit files.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CSV, Png and Fits__\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow functionality closely mirrors the `png_make.py` and `fits_make.py`  examples, which load results of\n",
    "model-fits and output th em as .png files and .fits files to quickly summarise results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same initial fit creating results in a folder called `results_folder_csv_png_fits` is therefore used.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Interferometer__\n",
    "\n",
    "This script can easily be adapted to analyse the results of charge injection imaging model-fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only entries that needs changing are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `ImagingAgg` -> `InterferometerAgg`.\n",
    " - `FitImagingAgg` -> `FitInterferometerAgg`.\n",
    " - `ImagingPlotter` -> `InterferometerPlotter`.\n",
    " - `FitImagingPlotter` -> `FitInterferometerPlotter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantities specific to an interfometer, for example its uv-wavelengths real space mask, are accessed using the same API\n",
    "(e.g. `values(\"dataset.uv_wavelengths\")` and `.values{\"dataset.real_space_mask\")).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Database File__\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregator can also load results from a `.sqlite` database file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is beneficial when loading results for large numbers of model-fits (e.g. more than hundreds)\n",
    "because it is optimized for fast querying of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the package `results/database` for a full description of how to set up the database and the benefits it provides,\n",
    "especially if loading results from hard-disk is slow."
