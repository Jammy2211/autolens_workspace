        "Modeling Features: Mass Stellar Dark\n",
        "====================================\n",
        "\n",
        "The majority of example scripts fit a mass profile which represents the _total_ mass of the lens galaxy (its stars,\n",
        "dark matter and other components combined). This typically uses an `Isothermal` or `PowerLaw` mass profile.\n",
        "\n",
        "This script fits a mass model which decomposes the lens galaxy's mass into its stars and dark matter.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Advantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "Decomposed mass models measure direct properties of the stars and dark matter, for example the lens's stellar mass,\n",
        "dark matter mass and the relative distribution between the two. Total mass profiles only inform us about the\n",
        "superposition of these two components.\n",
        "\n",
        "Decomposed mass models couple the lens galaxy's light profile to its stellar mass distribution, meaning that\n",
        "additional information in the lens galaxy emission is used to constrain the mass model. Whilst total mass models\n",
        "also fit the lens light, they do not couple it to the mass model and thus do not exploit this extra information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Total mass models like the `Isothermal` and `PowerLaw` assume that the overall mass distribution of the lens galaxy\n",
        "can be described using a single elliptical coordinate system. The stellar and dark components of a decomposed mass\n",
        "model each have their own elliptical coordinate system, meaning that the mass model can be more complex and accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Disadvantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "Assumptions must be made about how light and mass are coupled. This script assumes a constant mass-to-light raito,\n",
        "however it is not clear this is a reliable assumption in many lens galaxies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**PyAutoLens** supports more complex mass models which introduce a radial gradient into the mass-to-light ratio.\n",
        "However, these are more complex and therefore are difficult to fit robustly. Furthermore, it is still not clear\n",
        "whether the way they couple light to mass is a reliable assumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "Performing ray-tracing with decomposed mass models is also more computationally expensive, meaning that the run times\n",
        "of model-fits using these models is typically longer than total mass models.\n",
        "\n",
