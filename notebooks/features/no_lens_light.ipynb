        "================================\n",
        "\n",
        "CCD imaging data of a strong lens may not have lens galaxy light emission present, for example if the lens galaxy light\n",
        "has already been subtracted from the image. \n",

        "\n",
        "The main advantage of fitting data without lens light is the reduction in the number of free parameters in the\n",
        "model-fit. In the `start_here.py` example, the lens galaxy's light profile was composed of a `bulge` and `disk` which\n",
        "were both Sersic profiles, which contributed an extra N=12 free parameters. Without the lens light we therefore\n",
        "reduce the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space by 12, which makes the model-fit much faster and more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Disadvantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "If the lens light was simply not present in the observed data (e.g. it was too faint at the wavelength of the\n",
        "observation) then there is no option but to fit the data without lens light, and therefore there is also no disadvantage.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are fitting data where the lens light was subtracted before lens modeling (e.g. using a Sersic\n",
        "subtraction or GUI / b-splines based fitting), there are disadvantages.\n",
        "\n",
        "The lens light subtraction process may not be clean. The lens and source light are blended with one another in the\n",
        "data (e.g. due to PSF convlution). The process may over subtract source light in certain regions of the data and\n",
        "fail to subtract lens light in other regions. This will distort the lensed source emission input into the lens\n",
        "modeling and therefore potentially bias the inferred mass model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Performing lens and source modeling simultanoeusly means that the model-fit can find the optimal deblending of the two\n",
