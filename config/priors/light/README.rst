The ``light`` folder contains configuration files for the default priors assumed for light profiles in **PyAutoLens** (e.g. ``Sersic``, ``Gaussian``).

Folders
-------

- ``standard``: Configs for standard light profiles (specified via ``ag.lp.``), which include an ``intensity`` parameter to control their overall amount of emission.
- ``linear``: Configs for linear light profiles (specified via ``ag.lp_linear.``),, where the ``intensity`` parameter is implicitly solved for via linear algebra.
- ``shapelets``: Configs for shapelets (specified via ``ag.lp_shapelets.``), which decomposed the light of a galaxy via shapelet basis functions.
- ``operated``: Configs for operated light profiles (specified via ``ag.lp_operated.``), where the light profile represents the already PSF convolved emission.
- ``linear_operated``: Configs for linear operated light profiles (specified via ``ag.lp_linear_operated.``), which behave like operated light profiles but with a linearly solved for ``intensity``.
