The priors/limit config files set hard limits on the values allowed for every parameter.

For example, if the limits on a parameter are param = 0.0,2.0, only values between a lower limit of 0.0 and upper
limit of 2.0 can be sampled during the non-linear search. If the non-linear optimizer assumes a value outside of these
limits the model is resampled.

Limits are applied to all types of priors, e.g. UniformPrior, GaussianPrior, LogUniformPrior. It is not desirable for
the limits of a UniformPrior or LogUniformPrior to extend beyond the limits specified by these config files.
