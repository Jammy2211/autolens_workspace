# The `plots` section customizes every image that is output to hard-disk during a model-fit.

# For example, if `plots: fit: subplot_fit=True``, the ``subplot_fit.png`` subplot file will
# be plotted every time visualization is performed.

# There are two settings which are important for inspecting results via the dataset after a fit is complete which are:

# - `fits_dataset`: This outputs `dataset.fits` which the database functionality may use to reperform fits.
# -`fits_adapt_images`, This outputs `adapt_images.fits` which the database functionality may use to reperform fits.

# These can be disabled to save on hard-disk space but will lead to certain database functionality being disabled.
