    "\n",
    "In lens modeling, we want to find the combination of light profiles and mass profiles which accurate reproduce the observed image. How do we go about doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we have to choose our lens model parametrization. We don't need to specify the values of its light and mass profiles (e.g. the centre, einstein_radius, etc.), only the profiles themselves. In this example, we'll use the following lens model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) An Elliptical Isothermal Profile (SIE) for the lens galaxy's mass.\n",
    "2) An External Shear, which accounts for lensing by line-of-sight galaxies near the lens.\n",
    "3) An Elliptical Sersic light profile for the source galaxy's light.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll let you into a secret - this is the same lens model I used to simulate the image we're going to fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we infer the light and mass profile parameters that give a good fit to our data?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could randomly guess a lens model, corresponding to some random set of parameters. We could use this model to create a tracer and fit the image-data, and quantify how good the fit was using its likelihood. If we keep guessing lens models, eventually we'd find one that provides a good fit (i.e. a high likelihood) to the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "It may sound surprising, but this is the basis of how lens modeling works. However, we can do a lot better than random guesses. Instead, we track the likelihood of our previous guesses and guess, on average, more models which use combinations of light-profile and mass-profile parameters that gave higher likelihood solutions previously. If a set of parameters provided a good fit to the data, another set with similar values probably will too!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a 'non-linear search' and its a fairly tool used in science. In the howtolens lectures, we go into the details of how a non-linear search works. For the quick-start tutorial, we'll omit the nitty-gritty details.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use a non-linear search called 'MultiNest'. I highly recommend it and find its great for lens modeling. However, lets not worry about the details of how MultiNest actually works. Instead, just picture that a non-linear search in PyAutoLens operates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Randomly guess a lens model and use its light-profiles and mass-profiles to set up a lens galaxy, source galaxy and a tracer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Use this tracer to perform a fit, which generates a model image and compares it to the observed strong lens image, providing a likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Repeat this many times, using the likelihoods of previous fits (typically those with a high likelihood) to find lens models with higher likelihoods.\n"
