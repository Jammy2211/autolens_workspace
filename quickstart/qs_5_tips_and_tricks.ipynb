    "Its time to model your own lens data! This is straight forward - just adapt the runner script you ran above to load your own imaging data instead of the example data we ran previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to make sure the data conforms to the PyAutoLens inputs. This requires that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The image is a small (e.g. 501 x 501) cut-out of the strong lens, centred on the lens galaxy.\n",
    "2) The image and noise-map are in electrons per second.\n",
    "3) The PSF is cut-out to an odd-sized kernel with a reasonably small kernel size (e.g. 21x21).\n",
    "\n",
    "PyAutoLens has built-in tools to convert your data to these requirements, checkout the scripts in 'autolens_workspace/tools/loading_and_preparing_data'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data probably won't have a custom mask ready in a 'mask.fits' file. You have two options:\n",

    "We can also manually specify a set of image-pixels which correspond to the multiple images of the source-galaxy(s). During the analysis, PyAutoLens will first check that these pixels trace within a specified arc-second threshold of one another (which is controlled by the 'position_threshold' input into a phase). This provides two benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The analysis runs faster, as the non-linear search avoids searching regions of parameter space where the mass-model is clearly not accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) By removing these solutions, a global-maximum solution may be reached instead of a local-maxima. This is because removing the incorrect mass models makes the non-linear parameter space less complex.\n",

    "So far, all the models we've run have used analytic light profiles to fit for the source galaxy (e.g. Sersic's). However, most strongly lensed sources are more complex then these simplistic symmetric light profiles, and our lens modeling  benefits from reconstructing the source using a more general approach, called an 'inversion'. This basically  reconstructs the source's light using a pixelized-grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use an inversion, checkout the pipeline 'pipelines/simple/lens_sersic_sie_shear_source_inversion.py' and the runner 'runners/simple/runner_lens_light_mass_and_source_inversion.py'. By default, these pipelines use an adaptive pixelization whereby the inversion's pixels adapt to the surface brightness of the source.\n",

    "I would strongly recommend you only use inversions in conjuction with the positions feature described above. Inversions run a high risk of going to incorrect solutions if this feature is not used! \n",

    "__FEATURES / ADVANCED / HYPER FUNCTIONALITY__\n",

    "Once you've modeled some of your own lenses and feel more familar with PyAutoLens, You should check out the following places in the autolens_workspace:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) 'pipelines/features' and 'runners/features'. These describe pipeline features that customize an analysis of a strong lens, for example by binning up the data to a coarser resolution of performing ray-tracing on a higher resolution 'sub-grid'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) 'pipelines/advanced' and 'runners/advanced'. These advanced pipelines and runners allow for a much broader range of complex lens models to be fitted, and allow for different pipelines to be hyper_combined together so that the early phases of a pipeline can be reused when fitting more complex models later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) 'pipelines/hyper' and 'runners/hyper'. Hyper functionality is where PyAutoLens adapt the model fit to the data its fitting. This includes fitting for the background sky subtracton in the image and scaling the noise-map to prevent over-fitting small portions of the data. Only once you're confident with PyAutoLens would I recommend that you start experimenting with this functionality!"
