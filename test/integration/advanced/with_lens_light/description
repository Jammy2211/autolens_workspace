These runners model strong lens images where the lens galaxy's light is present and therefore needs to be fitted and
subtracted throughout the analysis.

The runners use pipelines that fit the different components of the strong lens as follows:

LENS LIGHT:

The runners use either a single elliptical Sersic profile or a two-component bulge + disk model, where the bulge is
an elliptical Sersic and the disk an elliptical Exponential profile. The geometry of the bulge + disk model can be
customized by the runner.

LENS MASS:

The runners use 'total-mass models' that represents all of the lens galaxy's matter (e.g. stellar and dark). The
profiles used are elliptical Isothermal and Power-Law profiles.

SOURCE LIGHT:

The runners use either a a single elliptical Sersic profile or a pixelized source reconstruction (or 'inversion').

LENS LIGHT AND MASS:

The runners use either a single elliptical Sersic profile or a two-component bulge + disk model, where the bulge is
an elliptical Sersic and the disk an elliptical Exponential profile. The geometry of the bulge + disk model can be
customized by the runner.

These light profiles are connected to the mass mdoel via a mass-to-light profile. Thus, they:

- Exploit information in the lens galaxy's light to constrain the lens mass model.
- Explicitly model the stellar mass distribution of the lens galaxy (unlike 'total mass models').

The lens galaxy's dark matter is modeled simultaneously, using an spherical NFW profile.
