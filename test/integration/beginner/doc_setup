Beginner pipelines have a small number settings that can be passed to the source, light or mass Setup objects.

# SOURCE #

    Below, we give an example of a Source setup using all options available to a beginner pipeline:

    source_setup = al.setup.Source(
        pixelization=al.pix.VoronoiBrightnessImage,
        regularization=al.reg.AdaptiveBrightness,
    )


    pixelization : al.pix

        If a source inversion pipeline is run, this sets the pixelization used by the source inversion.
        This pixelization will be used by all subsequent pipelines (e.g. light, mass, etc.).

        If a source inversion pipeline is not run (e.g. only a parametric source pipeline is used) this pixelization
        is not used and the parametric source model is used by all subsequent pipelines (e.g. light, mass, etc.).

    regularization : al.reg

        If a source inversion pipeline is run, this sets the regularization used by the source inversion.
        This regularization will be used by all subsequent pipelines (e.g. light, mass, etc.).

        If a source inversion pipeline is not run (e.g. only a parametric source pipeline is used) this regularization
        is not used and the parametric source model is used by all subsequent pipelines (e.g. light, mass, etc.).

# Light #

    Below, we give an example of a Light setup using all options available to a beginner pipeline:

    light_setup = al.setup.Light(
        align_bulge_disk_centre=True,
        align_bulge_disk_axis_ratio=False,
        align_bulge_disk_phi=False,
        disk_as_Sersic=True,
    )

    align_bulge_disk_centre : bool (default=True)

        If a bulge_disk light pipeline is run, this determines if the centre of bulge and disk components are aligned
        during the model fit.

        This bulge-disk centroid alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines (e.g. mass).

    align_bulge_disk_axis_ratio : bool (default=False)

        If a bulge_disk light pipeline is run, this determines if the axis_ratio's of bulge and disk components are
        forced to be the same during the model fit.

        This bulge-disk axis-ratio alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines (e.g. mass).

    align_bulge_disk_phi : bool (default=False)

        If a bulge_disk light pipeline is run, this determines if the centre of bulge and disk components are aligned
        during the model fit.

        This bulge-disk rotational alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines (e.g. mass).

    disk_as_sersic : bool (default=False)

        If True, the disk component of the bulge-disk lens light profile will be modeled using an EllipticalSersic
        profile as opposed to an EllipticalExponential.

        This disk model will be used in all subsequents pipelines (e.g. mass).


# Mass #

    Below, we give an example of a Mass setup using all options available to a beginner pipeline:

    mass_setup = al.setup.Mass(
        no_shear=False,
    )

    no_shear : bool (default=False)

        If True, the mass pipeline does not include a shear in the lens mass model.

        This mass model is used in any subsequent pipeline.
