Intermediate pipelines have a number of additional settings that can be passed to the general, source, light or mass
Setup objects.

# GENERAL #

    Below, we given an example of a General setup using all options available to an intermediate pipeline:

    general_setup = al.setup.General(
        hyper_galaxies=False,
        hyper_background_noise=False,
        hyper_image_sky=False,
    )

    hyper_galaxies : bool (default=False)

        If true, hyper-galaxies are used to scale the noise-map between all phases of each pipeline.

    hyper_background_noise : bool (default=False)

        If true, the level of background noise is modeled throughout the pipeline.

    hyper_image_sky : bool (default=False)

        If true, the background sky is modeled throughout the pipeline.

# SOURCE #

    Below, we give an example of a Source setup using all options available to an intermediate pipeline:

    source_setup = al.setup.Source(
        pixelization=al.pix.VoronoiBrightnessImage,
        regularization=al.reg.AdaptiveBrightness,
    )


    pixelization : al.pix

        If a source inversion pipeline is run, this sets the pixelization used by the source inversion.
        This pixelization will be used by all subsequent pipelines (e.g. light, mass, etc.).

        If a source inversion pipeline is not run (e.g. only a parametric source pipeline is used) this pixelization
        is not used and the parametric source model is used by all subsequent pipelines (e.g. light, mass, etc.).

    regularization : al.reg

        If a source inversion pipeline is run, this sets the regularization used by the source inversion.
        This regularization will be used by all subsequent pipelines (e.g. light, mass, etc.).

        If a source inversion pipeline is not run (e.g. only a parametric source pipeline is used) this regularization
        is not used and the parametric source model is used by all subsequent pipelines (e.g. light, mass, etc.).


# Light #

    Below, we give an example of a Light setup using all options available to an intermediate pipeline:

    light_setup = al.setup.Light(
        align_bulge_disk_centre=True,
        align_bulge_disk_axis_ratio=False,
        align_bulge_disk_phi=False,
        disk_as_Sersic=True,
    )

    align_bulge_disk_centre : bool (default=True)

        If a bulge_disk light pipeline is run, this determines if the centre of bulge and disk components are aligned
        during the model fit.

        This bulge-disk centroid alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines (e.g. mass).

    align_bulge_disk_axis_ratio : bool (default=False)

        If a bulge_disk light pipeline is run, this determines if the axis_ratio's of bulge and disk components are
        forced to be the same during the model fit.

        This bulge-disk axis-ratio alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines (e.g. mass).

    align_bulge_disk_phi : bool (default=False)

        If a bulge_disk light pipeline is run, this determines if the centre of bulge and disk components are aligned
        during the model fit.

        This bulge-disk rotational alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines (e.g. mass).

    disk_as_sersic : bool (default=False)

        If True, the disk component of the bulge-disk lens light profile will be modeled using an EllipticalSersic
        profile as opposed to an EllipticalExponential.

        This disk model will be used in all subsequents pipelines (e.g. mass).


# Mass #

    Below, we give an example of a Mass setup using all options available to an intermediate pipeline:

    mass_setup = al.setup.Mass(
        no_shear=False,
        align_light_dark_centre=False,
        align_bulge_dark_centre=False,
    )


    no_shear : bool (default=False)

        If True, the mass pipeline does not include a shear in the lens mass model.

        This mass model is used in any subsequent pipeline.

    align_light_dark_centre : bool (default=False)

        If a light_dark mass pipeline is run using a light profile composed of a single light profile (e.g. just a
        Sersic), this determines if the centre of the dark component (an NFW) and the light profile are forced to be the
        same during the model fit.

        This light-dark centroid alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines.

    align_bulge_dark_centre : bool (default=False)

        If a light_dark mass pipeline is run using a light profile composed of a bulge-disk light profile, this
        determines if the centre of the dark component (an NFW) and the bulge profile are forced to be the
        same during the model fit.

        This bulge-dark centroid alignment will be used in all subsequents pipelines.
