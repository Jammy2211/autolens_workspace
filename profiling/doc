Tools for profiling the computational run-speed of PyAutoLens, using different types of analysis, data and so fourth.

Before running profiling tools, you must generate the profiling datasets by running the scripts

    - profiling/imaging/simulator/data_maker.py
    - profiling/interferometer/simulator/data_maker.py

For imaging data, the profiling simulation suite simulates images representative of the following instruments:

    - lsst (pixel_scale=0.2)
    - euclid (pixel_scale=0.1)
    - hst (pixel_scale=0.05)
    - hst_up (pixel_scale=0.03)
    - ao (pixel_scale=0.01)
