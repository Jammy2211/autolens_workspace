# In this example, we will load the residual map of a fit from a .fits file and plot it using the function
# autolens.data.plotters.array_plotters.plot_array.

# We will use the residuals of a fit to slacs1430+4105, which comes from running the example pipeline
# 'workspacde/pipelines/examples/lens_light_and_x1_source_parametric.py.

# We have included the .fits data required for this example in the directory
# 'workspace/output/example/slacs1430+4105/pipeline_light_and_x1_source_parametric/phase_3_both/image/fits'.

# However, the complete set of optimizer results for the pipeline are not included, as the large file sizes prohibit
# distribution. Therefore, you may wish to run this pipeline now on slacs1430+4105 to generate your own results.

# We will customize the appearance of this figure to highlight the features of the residual map.
