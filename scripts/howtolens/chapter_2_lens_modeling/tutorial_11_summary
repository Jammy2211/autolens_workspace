Congratulations, you've completed the second chapter of the **PyAutoLens** tutorials!

In this chapter, you learnt:

1) What a non-linear search is.
2) How to use a non-linear search to sample the parameter space of a model.
3) How the priors we give parameters specify our search of this parameter space.
4) How one must carefully balance complexity and realism when fitting a model to a data-set.
5) The importance of factoring in run-speed when modeling a lens, and tricks to speed up the analysis.
6) About masking data and using positions in the analysis.

At this point, you are ready to begin modeling lenses. The 'modeling' folders in the
autolens_workspace contains a number of scripts that can be easily adopted to model lens using a variety of different
approaches, lens models and non-linear searches. If you have your own lens data, I'd recommend you adapt these
scripts to your data. If you don't have your own data, checkout the 'simulators' folder to simulate your own dataset!

Alternatively, you may wish to continue on to chapter 3 on search chaining.
