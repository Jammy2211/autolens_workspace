Modeling: Combined Imaging + Point Source
=========================================

This script jointly fits CCD imaging of a lensed quasar's **extended arcs** and its **point-source
observables** (image positions and time delays) with a **single lens mass model**, using PyAutoFit's
factor-graph API to sample the joint likelihood with one non-linear search.

We model **real data**: the quadruply imaged quasar **RXJ1131-1231** (z_source = 0.658, lensed by an
elliptical at z_lens = 0.295), the same system fitted with point-source observables alone in
`point_source/start_here.py`. Here we add HST imaging of the system, whose spectacular arc — the
quasar's host galaxy stretched around the lens — carries mass-model information the point positions
alone cannot access.

__Why combine them?__

The two datasets constrain the same mass model in complementary ways:

 - **Point-source observables** (positions, time delays) are exquisitely precise constraints at the
   four image locations, and the delays carry absolute-distance information — but four points only
   loosely pin the mass profile's radial slope.

 - **Extended arcs** trace the mass model continuously around the Einstein ring, breaking profile
   degeneracies — this is why time-delay cosmography analyses of this very lens (Suyu et al. 2013)
   model the arcs and the point data together.

__The Data__

 - Imaging: an HST H-band cutout of RXJ1131 fetched from the CDS hips2fits service on first run
   (~160 kB, cached). HiPS pixel values are drizzled/resampled from the original exposures, so this
   is real sky data at demonstration grade: we estimate a constant background RMS noise-map from the
   image edges and adopt a Gaussian PSF, which is sufficient to teach the joint workflow (a
   publication-grade analysis would use the reduced exposures, their weight maps and a measured
   PSF).
 - Point data: the committed `dataset/point_source/rxj1131/point_dataset_with_time_delays.json` —
   HST image positions (Suyu et al. 2013) and COSMOGRAIL time delays (Tewes et al. 2013).

__Contents__

- **Dataset:** Download/load both datasets; build the imaging noise-map and PSF; mask.
- **Quasar Image Masking:** Scale the noise at the four quasar image positions so the imaging fit
  targets the arcs.
- **Model:** One mass model shared by both datasets' analyses.
- **Analysis Factor & Factor Graph:** Combine the imaging and point analyses into one search.
- **Search & Model-Fit:** Nautilus over the shared parameter space.
- **Result:** Reading the joint constraints.

__Quasar Image Masking__

The four quasar images are far brighter than the arcs and would dominate the imaging chi-squared;
modeling them in the image plane requires PSF deblending (see
`point_source/features/deblending/modeling.py`). The standard shortcut is to remove them from the imaging
fit: we scale the noise to very large values in a small circle around each observed image position,
so the imaging likelihood is driven by the arcs and lens light. Their information is not lost — the
point-source dataset carries it, at higher precision than the pixels could.

The **mass model is composed once and shared**: the same `Isothermal` + `ExternalShear` model

 - The imaging model adds an MGE lens-light bulge and an MGE source (the quasar's host galaxy,
   which forms the arcs).
 - The point model adds the `Point` source whose (y,x) centre the positions and delays constrain.

The quasar sits in its host galaxy, so their source-plane centres are physically coincident; we
keep them as separate free parameters here for simplicity (tying them is a one-line prior
customization).
