The ``sample`` folder contains example scripts for simulating imaging datasets (E.g. ALMA)
consisting of large samples of galaxies.

This is done by creating a model of the sample's overall population parameters and drawing model parameters
from these prior distributions.

The API for these features is the same irrespective of the dataset fitted. Therefore, please refer to the folder
`autolens_workspace/*/interferometer/simulators/sample` for example scripts, which can be copy and pasted
into scripts which simulate interferometer data.
