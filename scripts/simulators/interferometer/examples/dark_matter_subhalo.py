Simulator: Subhalo
==================

This script simulates `Interferometer` data of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens where:

 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear`.
 - The subhalo`s `MassProfile` is a `NFWSph`.
 - The source galaxy's light is an `Sersic`.

__Dataset Paths__

The `dataset_type` describes the type of data being simulated (in this case, `Interferometer` data) and `dataset_name` 
gives it a descriptive name. 

 - The image will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/image.fits`.
 - The noise-map will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/noise_map.fits`.
 - The psf will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/psf.fits`.
"""
dataset_type = "interferometer"
dataset_name = "dark_matter_subhalo"

The path where the dataset will be output, which in this case is
`/autolens_workspace/dataset/interferometer/dark_matter_subhalo`
"""
dataset_path = path.join("dataset", dataset_type, dataset_name)

"""
__Simulate__

For simulating interferometer data of a strong lens, we recommend using a Grid2D object with a `sub_size` of 1. This
simplifies the generation of the strong lens image in real space before it is transformed to Fourier space.
"""
grid = al.Grid2D.uniform(shape_native=(800, 800), pixel_scales=0.05)

"""
To perform the Fourier transform we need the wavelengths of the baselines, which we'll load from the fits file below.

By default we use baselines from the Square Mile Array (SMA), which produces low resolution interferometer data that
can be fitted extremely efficiently. The `autolens_workspace` includes ALMA uv_wavelengths files for simulating
much high resolution datasets (which can be performed by replacing "sma.fits" below with "alma.fits").
"""
uv_wavelengths_path = path.join("dataset", dataset_type, "uv_wavelengths")
uv_wavelengths = al.util.array_1d.numpy_array_1d_via_fits_from(
    file_path=path.join(uv_wavelengths_path, "sma.fits"), hdu=0
)

"""
To simulate the interferometer dataset we first create a simulator, which defines the shape, resolution and pixel-scale 
of the visibilities that are simulated, as well as its exposure time, noise levels and uv-wavelengths.
"""
simulator = al.SimulatorInterferometer(
    uv_wavelengths=uv_wavelengths,
    exposure_time=300.0,
    noise_sigma=1000.0,
    transformer_class=al.TransformerDFT,
)

"""
__Ray Tracing__

Setup the lens galaxy's mass (SIE+Shear), subhalo (NFW) and source galaxy light (elliptical Sersic) for this 
simulated lens.

For lens modeling, defining ellipticity in terms of the `ell_comps` improves the model-fitting procedure.

However, for simulating a strong lens you may find it more intuitive to define the elliptical geometry using the 
axis-ratio of the profile (axis_ratio = semi-major axis / semi-minor axis = b/a) and position angle, where angle is
in degrees and defined counter clockwise from the positive x-axis.

We can use the `convert` module to determine the elliptical components from the axis-ratio and angle.

Use these galaxies to setup a tracer, which will generate the image for the simulated interferometer dataset.

__Tracer json__

Save the `Tracer` in the dataset folder as a .json file, ensuring the true light profiles, mass profiles and galaxies
are safely stored and available to check how the dataset was simulated in the future.
