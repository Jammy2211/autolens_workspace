"""
Simulator: Hubble Constant Time Delays
======================================

A multiply imaged lensed quasar with time delays can measure the Hubble constant, which is a fundamental
Cosmological parameter that describes the rate of expansion of the universe. This is because the
the difference between the geometric time delay and the physical time delay is proportional to the Hubble constant.

This script illustrates how to simulate a sample of `PointDataset` datasets of lensed quasars, which
can easily be used to simulate hundreds or thousands of strong lenses. These, as a sample, can be used to constrain
the Hubble constant.

To simulate the sample of lenses, each lens and source galaxies are set up using the `Model` object which is also used
in  the `modeling` scripts. This means that the parameters of each simulated strong lens are drawn from the
distributions  defined via priors, which can be customized to simulate a wider range of strong lenses.

The sample is used in `autolens_workspace/notebooks/advanced/graphical` to illustrate how a graphical and hierarchical
model can be fitted to a large sample of double Einstein ring strong lenses in order to improve the constraints on
Cosmological parameters.

__Model__

This script simulates a sample of `PointDataset` data of 'galaxy-scale' strong lenses where:

 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal`.
 - The source `Galaxy` is a `Point`.
 - The Cosmology is `Planck15` and has a Hubble constant which can be constrained by the time delays.

"""
__Dataset Paths__

The `dataset_type` describes the type of data being simulated and `dataset_name` gives it a descriptive name. 
"""
dataset_label = "samples"
dataset_type = "point_source"
dataset_sample_name = "hubble_constant_time_delays"

"""
The path where the dataset will be output.
"""
dataset_path = Path("dataset") / dataset_type / dataset_label / dataset_sample_name

"""
__Point Solver__

We use a `PointSolver` to locate the multiple images. 
"""
grid = al.Grid2D.uniform(
    shape_native=(200, 200),
    pixel_scales=0.05,  # <- The pixel-scale describes the conversion from pixel units to arc-seconds.
)

solver = al.PointSolver.for_grid(
    grid=grid, pixel_scale_precision=0.001, magnification_threshold=0.1
)

"""
__Sample Model Distributions__

To simulate a sample, we draw random instances of lens and source galaxies where the parameters of their mass profiles 
and point source profiles are drawn from distributions. These distributions are defined via priors -- the same objects 
that are used when defining the priors of each parameter for a non-linear search.

Below, we define the distributions the lens galaxy's mass profiles are drawn from alongside the source's point
source centre.
"""
mass = af.Model(al.mp.Isothermal)

mass.centre = (0.0, 0.0)
mass.ell_comps.ell_comps_0 = af.GaussianPrior(mean=0.0, sigma=0.1)
mass.ell_comps.ell_comps_1 = af.GaussianPrior(mean=0.0, sigma=0.1)

lens = af.Model(al.Galaxy, redshift=0.5, mass=mass)

point = af.Model(al.ps.Point)

point.centre_0 = af.GaussianPrior(mean=0.0, sigma=0.1)
point.centre_1 = af.GaussianPrior(mean=0.0, sigma=0.1)


"""
We also include a light profile component of the source, which is to aid visualization of the simulated dataset
by providing an image where the point source is located.
"""
bulge = af.Model(al.lp.ExponentialSph)

bulge.centre_0 = point.centre_0
bulge.centre_1 = point.centre_1
bulge.intensity = 1.0

"""
__Sample Instances__

Within a for loop, we will now generate instances of the lens and source galaxies using the `Model`'s defined above.
This loop will run for `total_datasets` iterations, which sets the number of lenses that are simulated.

Each iteration of the for loop will then create a tracer and use this to simulate the point dataset.
