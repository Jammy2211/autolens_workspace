Simulator: Group
================

This script simulates an example strong lens on the 'group' scale, where there is a single primary lens galaxy
and two smaller galaxies nearby, whose mass contributes significantly to the ray-tracing and is therefore included in
the strong lens model.

This script simulates `Imaging` of a 'group-scale' strong lens where:

 - The group consists of three lens galaxies whose ligth distributions are `SersicSph` profiles and
 total mass distributions are `IsothermalSph` profiles.
 - A single source galaxy is observed whose `LightProfile` is an `Sersic`.

__Dataset Paths__

The `dataset_type` describes the type of data being simulated and `dataset_name` gives it a descriptive name. They define the folder the dataset is output to on your hard-disk:

 - The image will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/image.fits`.
 - The noise-map will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/noise_map.fits`.
 - The psf will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/psf.fits`.
"""
dataset_type = "group"
dataset_name = "simple"

"""
The path where the dataset will be output. 

In this example, this is: `/autolens_workspace/dataset/group/simple`
"""
dataset_path = Path("dataset", dataset_type, dataset_name)

"""
__Grid__

Define the 2d grid of (y,x) coordinates that the lens and source galaxy images are evaluated and therefore simulated 
on, via the inputs:

 - `shape_native`: The (y_pixels, x_pixels) 2D shape of the grid defining the shape of the data that is simulated.
 - `pixel_scales`: The arc-second to pixel conversion factor of the grid and data.
"""
grid = al.Grid2D.uniform(
    shape_native=(250, 250),
    pixel_scales=0.1,
)

"""
__Over Sampling__

Over sampling is a numerical technique where the images of light profiles and galaxies are evaluated 
on a higher resolution grid than the image data to ensure the calculation is accurate. 

For lensing calculations, the high magnification regions of a lensed source galaxy require especially high levels of 
over sampling to ensure the lensed images are evaluated accurately.

Over sampling is a numerical technique where the images of light profiles and galaxies are evaluated 
on a higher resolution grid than the image data to ensure the calculation is accurate. 

An adaptive oversampling scheme is implemented, evaluating the central regions at (0.0", 0.0") of the light profile at a 
resolution of 32x32, transitioning to 8x8 in intermediate areas, and 2x2 in the outskirts. This ensures precise and 
accurate image simulation while focusing computational resources on the bright regions that demand higher oversampling.

This adaptive over sampling is also applied at the centre of every over galaxy in the group.

An adaptive oversampling grid cannot be defined for the lensed source because its light appears in different regions of 
the image plane for each dataset. For this reason, most workspace examples utilize cored light profiles for the 
source galaxy. Cored light profiles change gradually in their central regions, allowing accurate evaluation without 
requiring oversampling.

Once you are more experienced, you should read up on over-sampling in more detail via 
the `autolens_workspace/*/guides/over_sampling.ipynb` notebook.

__Main Galaxies and Extra Galaxies__

For a group-scale lens, we designate there to be two types of lens galaxies in the system:

 - `main_galaxies`: The main lens galaxies which likely make up the majority of light and mass in the lens system.
 These are modeled individually with a unique name for each, with their light and mass distributions modeled using 
 parametric models.
 
 - `extra_galaxies`: The extra galaxies which are nearby the lens system and contribute to the lensing of the source
  galaxy. These are modeled with a more restrictive model, for example with their centres fixed to the observed
  centre of light and their mass distributions modeled using a scaling relation. These are grouped into a single 
  `extra_galaxies` collection.
  
In this simple example group scale lens, there is one main lens galaxy and two extra galaxies. 

__Ray Tracing__

Setup the mass models of the main lens galaxy (`Isothermal` and `ExternalShear1), source 
galaxy (`SersicCore` and `Point`) and two extra galaxies using the `IsothermalSph` model and the source galaxy light 
using an elliptical `Sersic`.
