"""
Simulator: Double Einstein Ring
===============================

A double Einstein ring lens is a strong lens system where there are two source galaxies at different redshifts
behind the lens galaxy. They appear as two distinct Einstein rings in the image-plane, and can constrain
Cosmological parameters in a way single Einstein ring lenses cannot.

This script simulates a double Einstein ring lens, which is used in `modeling/features/double_einstein_ring.py`
and other script to illustrate how to model these systems correctly.

__Model__

This script simulates `Imaging` of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens where there are two source's at different different
redshifts, creating a double einstein ring. Specifically:

 - The first lens galaxy's light is an `Sersic` and total mass distribution is an `Isothermal`.
 - The second galaxy, which is the first source galaxy,  total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and its light is
 an `Sersic`.
 - The third galaxy, which is the second source galaxy, light profile is an `Sersic`.

__Start Here Notebook__

If any code in this script is unclear, refer to the `simulators/start_here.ipynb` notebook.

"""
__Dataset Paths__

The `dataset_type` describes the type of data being simulated (in this case, `Imaging` data) and `dataset_name`
gives it a descriptive name. 
"""
dataset_type = "imaging"
dataset_name = "double_einstein_ring"
dataset_path = path.join("dataset", dataset_type, dataset_name)

"""
__Simulate__

Simulate the image using a `Grid2D` with the `OverSamplingIterate` object.
"""
grid = al.Grid2D.uniform(
    shape_native=(100, 100),
    pixel_scales=0.1,
    over_sampling=al.OverSamplingIterate(
        fractional_accuracy=0.9999, sub_steps=[2, 4, 8, 16]
    ),
)

"""
Simulate a simple Gaussian PSF for the image.
"""
psf = al.Kernel2D.from_gaussian(
    shape_native=(11, 11), sigma=0.1, pixel_scales=grid.pixel_scales
)

"""
Create the simulator for the imaging data, which defines the exposure time, background sky, noise levels and psf.
"""
simulator = al.SimulatorImaging(
    exposure_time=300.0, psf=psf, background_sky_level=0.1, add_poisson_noise=True
)

"""
__Ray Tracing__

Setup the lens galaxy's light, mass and source galaxy light for this simulated lens.

The `Tracer` below is composed of three galaxies, a lens and two sources, where the first source also acts as a
lens for the second source.

The redshifts of the galaxies are used to determine how many images are formed of the source galaxies.

Use these galaxies to setup a tracer, which will generate the image for the simulated `Imaging` dataset.
"""

Lets look at the tracer`s image, this is the image we'll be simulating.

Pass the simulator a tracer, which creates the image which is simulated as an imaging dataset.

Plot the simulated `Imaging` dataset before outputting it to fits.

"""
__Visualize__

Output a subplot of the simulated dataset, the image and the tracer's quantities to the dataset path as .png files.

For a faster run time, the tracer visualization uses the binned grid instead of the iterative grid.

"""
__Tracer json__

Save the `Tracer` in the dataset folder as a .json file, ensuring the true light profiles, mass profiles and galaxies
are safely stored and available to check how the dataset was simulated in the future. 

This can be loaded via the method `tracer = al.from_json()`.

The dataset can be viewed in the 
folder `autolens_workspace/imaging/ double_einstein_ring`.
