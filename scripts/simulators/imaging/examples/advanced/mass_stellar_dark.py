"""
Simulator: Mass Stellar Dark
============================

The majority of example scripts simulate a mass profile which represents the _total_ mass of the lens galaxy (its stars,
dark matter and other components combined). This typically uses an `Isothermal` or `PowerLaw` mass profile.

This script simulates a strong lens where the lens mass model decomposes the lens galaxy's mass into its stars and
dark matter.

This dataset is modeled in the example script `autolens_workspace/scripts/modeling/imaging/features/mass_stellar_dark.py`,
where a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of fitting decomposed mass models is also given.

__Model__

This script simulates `Imaging` of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens using decomposed light and dark matter profiles where:

 - The lens galaxy's light matter mass distribution is an `Sersic`.
 - The lens galaxy's dark `MassProfile` is a `NFWSph`.
 - The source galaxy's light is an `Sersic`.

__Start Here Notebook__

If any code in this script is unclear, refer to the `simulators/start_here.ipynb` notebook.

"""
__Dataset Paths__

The `dataset_type` describes the type of data being simulated (in this case, `Imaging` data) and `dataset_name`
gives it a descriptive name. 
"""
dataset_type = "imaging"
dataset_name = "mass_stellar_dark"
dataset_path = path.join("dataset", dataset_type, dataset_name)

"""
__Simulate__

Simulate the image using a `Grid2D` with the `OverSamplingIterate` object.
"""
grid = al.Grid2D.uniform(
    shape_native=(100, 100),
    pixel_scales=0.1,
    over_sampling=al.OverSamplingIterate(
        fractional_accuracy=0.9999, sub_steps=[2, 4, 8, 16]
    ),
)

"""
Simulate a simple Gaussian PSF for the image.
"""
psf = al.Kernel2D.from_gaussian(
    shape_native=(11, 11), sigma=0.1, pixel_scales=grid.pixel_scales
)

"""
Create the simulator for the imaging data, which defines the exposure time, background sky, noise levels and psf.
"""
simulator = al.SimulatorImaging(
    exposure_time=300.0, psf=psf, background_sky_level=0.1, add_poisson_noise=True
)

"""
__Ray Tracing__

Setup the lens galaxy's light, mass and source galaxy light for this simulated lens.

The `lens_galaxy` uses a `bulge` component which has a light and mass profile, and there is also a dark matter 
component included.
"""
lens_galaxy = al.Galaxy(
    redshift=0.5,
    bulge=al.lmp.Sersic(
        centre=(0.0, 0.0),
        ell_comps=al.convert.ell_comps_from(axis_ratio=0.9, angle=45.0),
        intensity=1.0,
        effective_radius=0.8,
        sersic_index=4.0,
        mass_to_light_ratio=0.2,
    ),

"""
Use these galaxies to setup a tracer, which will generate the image for the simulated `Imaging` dataset.
"""
tracer = al.Tracer(galaxies=[lens_galaxy, source_galaxy])
tracer_plotter = aplt.TracerPlotter(tracer=tracer, grid=grid)
tracer_plotter.figures_2d(image=True)

"""
We can then pass this simulator a tracer, which uses the tracer to create a ray-traced image which is simulated as
imaging dataset following the setup of the dataset.
"""
dataset = simulator.via_tracer_from(tracer=tracer, grid=grid)

"""
Plot the simulated `Imaging` dataset before outputting it to fits.
"""
dataset_plotter = aplt.ImagingPlotter(dataset=dataset)
dataset_plotter.subplot_dataset()

"""
__Output__

Output the simulated dataset to the dataset path as .fits files.
"""
dataset.output_to_fits(
    data_path=path.join(dataset_path, "data.fits"),
    psf_path=path.join(dataset_path, "psf.fits"),
    noise_map_path=path.join(dataset_path, "noise_map.fits"),
    overwrite=True,
)

"""
__Visualize__

Output a subplot of the simulated dataset, the image and the tracer's quantities to the dataset path as .png files.

For a faster run time, the tracer visualization uses the binned grid instead of the iterative grid.
"""
mat_plot = aplt.MatPlot2D(output=aplt.Output(path=dataset_path, format="png"))

dataset_plotter = aplt.ImagingPlotter(dataset=dataset, mat_plot_2d=mat_plot)

tracer_plotter.subplot_tracer()
tracer_plotter.subplot_galaxies_images()

"""
__Tracer json__

Save the `Tracer` in the dataset folder as a .json file, ensuring the true light profiles, mass profiles and galaxies
are safely stored and available to check how the dataset was simulated in the future. 

This can be loaded via the method `tracer = al.from_json()`.
"""
al.output_to_json(
    obj=tracer,
    file_path=path.join(dataset_path, "tracer.json"),
)

"""
The dataset can be viewed in the folder `autolens_workspace/imaging/mass_stellar_dark`.
