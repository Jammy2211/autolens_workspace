Simulator: Group
================

This script simulates an example strong lens on the 'group' scale, where there is a single primary lens galaxy
and two smaller extra galaxies nearby, whose mass contributes significantly to the ray-tracing and is therefore
included in the strong lens model.

This script simulates `Imaging` of a 'group-scale' strong lens where:

 - The group consists of one main lens galaxy and two extra galaxies whose light distributions are `SersicSph`
 profiles and total mass distributions are `IsothermalSph` profiles.
 - A single source galaxy is observed whose `LightProfile` is a `SersicCore`.

__Main Lens Galaxies vs Extra Galaxies__

For group-scale lens modeling, galaxies are organized into two categories:

 - `main_lens_galaxies`: The primary lens galaxies that dominate the light and mass of the system. These are
   modeled individually with unique parametric light and mass profiles.

 - `extra_galaxies`: Companion galaxies near the lens system that contribute to lensing but are modeled with
   more restrictive assumptions (e.g. fixed centres, scaling relations).

Centres for each category are saved to separate JSON files (`main_lens_centres.json` and
`extra_galaxies_centres.json`) so that the modeling scripts can load them directly.

The `dataset_type` describes the type of data being simulated and `dataset_name` gives it a descriptive name. They define the folder the dataset is output to on your hard-disk:

 - The image will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/image.fits`.
 - The noise-map will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/noise_map.fits`.

"""
__Over Sampling__

Over sampling is a numerical technique where the images of light profiles and galaxies are evaluated
on a higher resolution grid than the image data to ensure the calculation is accurate.

For lensing calculations, the high magnification regions of a lensed source galaxy require especially high levels of
over sampling to ensure the lensed images are evaluated accurately.

Over sampling is a numerical technique where the images of light profiles and galaxies are evaluated
on a higher resolution grid than the image data to ensure the calculation is accurate.

An adaptive oversampling scheme is implemented, evaluating the central regions at (0.0", 0.0") of the light profile at a
resolution of 32x32, transitioning to 8x8 in intermediate areas, and 2x2 in the outskirts. This ensures precise and
accurate image simulation while focusing computational resources on the bright regions that demand higher oversampling.

This adaptive over sampling is also applied at the centre of every other galaxy in the group.

An adaptive oversampling grid cannot be defined for the lensed source because its light appears in different regions of
the image plane for each dataset. For this reason, most workspace examples utilize cored light profiles for the
source galaxy. Cored light profiles change gradually in their central regions, allowing accurate evaluation without
requiring oversampling.

Once you are more experienced, you should read up on over-sampling in more detail via
the `autolens_workspace/*/guides/over_sampling.ipynb` notebook.
