The ``group`` folder contains example scripts showing how to analyse group scale strong lenses,
which are lenses where 2-10 galaxies are responsible for the lensing of 1 or a few sources.

New users should read the ``start_here`` example, which gives an overview of all examples in the folder.

Results
-------

The ``modeling`` example performs lens modeling but only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the
results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/results``.
