"""
Modeling: Searches
==================

This script gives a run through of all non-linear searches that are available for modeling.

Extensive testing of lens modeling has shown that the default search used throughout all modeling examples,
`Nautilus`, is the most accurate and fastest search available. For users familiar with statistical inference, this may
be surprising, as nested samplers are traditionally slower than MCMC methods such as Emcee and maximum likelihood
methods such as LBFGS. A description of why Nautilus performs better than these other searches is beyond the scope
of this script, but if you add me on SLACk I'd be happy to have a discussion about it!

Therefore, unless you really know what you are doing or want to use an alternative search, it is strongly recommended
you stick to Nautilus.

Three different categories of searches are available, nested samplers (E.g. Nautilus, Dynesty), MCMC (E.g. Emcee) and
maximum likelihood (e.g. LBFGS). MCMC and MLE methods can often optionally use a "starting point" to initialize the
model-fit with the parameters where it should begin. Nested samplers do not use a starting point, but a similar
approach can be applied by putting tight priors on certain parameters.

To perform a model-fit, a fully modeling script will include steps which compose a model, create an `Analysis`
object and pass these to the search to perform the fit. We skip these steps for brevity.

"""
__Dynesty__

Dynesty (https://github.com/joshspeagle/dynesty) is a nested sampling algorithm.

Dynesty used to be the default model-fitting algorithm, before Nautilus was found to be better. However, Dynesty with
random walk nested sampling is still an effective method for modeling and worth using if you want to check your
results with an alternative to Nautilus.

Dynesty itself supports a wide variety of different nested sampling methods, including static 
sampling (`DynestyStatic` where the number of live point is fixed), dynamic sampling (`DynestyDynamic` where the number 
of live points varies with the fit) and different approaches to point sampling (e.g. slice sampling, uniform sampling). 

If you are familiar with nested sampling you can use all dynesty's different options by customizing the code below.

"""
__Emcee__

Emcee (https://github.com/dfm/emcee) is an ensemble MCMC sampler that is commonly used in Astronomy and Astrophysics.

The wrapper with **PyAutoFit** supports different initialization methods, including a ball around the center of the
priors on the model parameters, which is the recommend initialization method for Emcee.

It also includes functionality which checks the auto correlations of the chains, and terminates the search early
if they meet certain convergence criteria. This is useful for ensuring that the chains have converged.

Whilst Emcee is a popular choice of MCMC method in astrophsyics, note that the MCMC method `Zeus`, described next, has
proven better as lens modeling for our tests.

    path_prefix=Path("imaging", "searches"),
    name="Emcee",
    unique_tag="example",

    ),
)

"""
__Zeus__

Zeus (https://zeus-mcmc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an ensemble MCMC slice sampler.

The wrapper with **PyAutoFit** supports different initialization methods, including a ball around the center of the
priors on the model parameters, which is the recommend initialization method for Emcee.

It also includes functionality which checks the auto correlations of the chains, and terminates the search early
if they meet certain convergence criteria. This is useful for ensuring that the chains have converged.

Zeus is the most effective MCMC method for lens modeling that we have tested, and is the recommended MCMC method,
however its performance is not as good as Nautilus.

"""
__PySwarms__

PySwarms is a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

Information about PySwarms can be found at the following links:

 - https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms
 - https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
 - https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pyswarms.single.html#module-pyswarms.single.global_best

An PSO algorithm only seeks to only find the maximum likelihood lens model, unlike MCMC or nested sampling algorithms
like Zzeus and Nautilus, which aims to map-out parameter space and infer errors on the parameters.Therefore, in
principle, a PSO like PySwarm should fit a lens model very fast.

In our experience, the parameter spaces fitted by lens models are too complex for `PySwarms` to be used without a lot
of user attention and care.

"""
__Start Point__

For maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) non-linear searches, parameter space
sampling is built around having a "location" in parameter space.

This could simply be the parameters of the current maximum likelihood model in an MLE fit, or the locations of many
walkers in parameter space (e.g. MCMC).

For many model-fitting problems, we may have an expectation of where correct solutions lie in parameter space and
therefore want our non-linear search to start near that location of parameter space. Alternatively, we may want to
sample a specific region of parameter space, to determine what solutions look like there.

The start-point API allows us to do this, by manually specifying the start-point of an MLE fit or the start-point of
the walkers in an MCMC fit. Because nested sampling draws from priors, it cannot use the start-point API.

Similar behaviour can be achieved by customizing the priors of a model-fit. We could place `GaussianPrior`'s
centred on the regions of parameter space we want to sample, or we could place tight `UniformPrior`'s on regions
of parameter space we believe the correct answer lies.

The downside of using priors is that our priors have a direct influence on the parameters we infer and the size
of the inferred parameter errors. By using priors to control the location of our model-fit, we therefore risk
inferring a non-representative model.

For users more familiar with statistical inference, adjusting ones priors in the way described above leads to
changes in the posterior, which therefore impacts the model inferred.

# Lens:

mass = af.Model(al.mp.Isothermal)

mass.centre_0 = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=-0.1, upper_limit=0.1)
mass.centre_1 = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=-0.1, upper_limit=0.1)

"""
We now define the start point of certain parameters in the model:

 - The galaxy is centred near (0.0, 0.0), so we set a start point for its mass distribution there.

 - The size of the lensed source galaxy is around 1.6" thus we set the `einstein_radius` to start here.

 - We know the source galaxy is a disk galaxy, thus we set its `sersic_index` to start around 1.0.

For all parameters where the start-point is not specified (in this case the `ell_comps`, their 
parameter values are drawn randomly from the prior when determining the initial locations of the parameters.
"""
initializer = af.InitializerParamBounds(
    {
        model.galaxies.lens.mass.centre_0: (-0.01, 0.01),

        model.galaxies.source.bulge.sersic_index: (0.95, 1.05),
    }
)

"""
The `initializer` is passed to the search (e.g. the MCMC method Emcee below), which uses it to set the start-point of 
the walkers in parameter space.

__Search Cookbook__

There are a number of other searches supported by **PyAutoFit** and therefore which can be used, which are not 
explictly documented here. These include Ultranest and LBFGS. 

The **PyAutoFit** search cookbook documents all searches that are available, including those not documented here,
and provides the code you can easily copy and paste to use these methods.
