The ``searches`` folder contains example scripts which fit a model using different non-linear searches:

The API for these features is the same irrespective of the dataset fitted. Therefore, please refer to the folder
`autolens_workspace/*/modeling/imaging/searches` for example scripts, which can be copy and pasted
into scripts which model point-source datasets.
