The ``deblending`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis which deblends the bright lensed quasar
images of the point source from one another, and also from the foreground lens galaxy's light.

They allow for more precise measurement of the positions of the multiply images of the point source and for a model
of the lens light to be inferred.

The following example scripts illustrating lens modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Lens modeling in order to perform lensed quasar deblending.
- ``simulator``: Simulating strong lens data which benefits from deblending.

Results
-------

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/guides/results``.
