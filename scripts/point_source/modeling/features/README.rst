The ``modeling/features`` folder contains example scripts showing how to fit a lens model to a point source dataset:

The API for these features is the same irrespective of the dataset fitted.

Therefore, refer to the folder
`autolens_workspace/*/imaging/modeling/features` for example scripts, which can be copy
and pasted into scripts which model point source data.

Notes
-----

These scripts show how to perform lens modeling but only give a brief overview of how to analyse
and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/imaging/results``.
