The ``imaging/advanced`` folder contains example scripts for advanced functionality for analysing imaging datasets (E.g. Hubble Space Telescope).

Folders (Advanced)
------------------

- ``multi``: Examples for multiple datasets simultaneously (E.g. multi-wavelength imaging, imaging and interferometry).
- ``log_likelihood_function``: A step-by-step visual guide to how likelihoods are evaluated in **PyAutoLens**.
- ``chaining``: Using non-linear search chaining to fit complex lens models to imaging data.
- ``subhalo``: Fitting lens models for dark matter subhalo detection and sensitivity mapping.
- ``graphical``: Fitting graphical models to multiple imaging strong lens datasets simultaneously.
- ``misc``: Miscellaneous PyAutoLens features.
