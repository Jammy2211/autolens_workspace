"""
Chaining: Double Einstein Ring
==============================

This script chains two searches to fit `Imaging` data of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens which has two source galaxies at
two different redshifts, forming a double Einstein ring system. This fits a model where:

 - The lens galaxy's light is omitted.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal`.
 - The first source galaxy's mass is a `IsothermalSph` and its light an MGE.
 - The second source galaxy's light is an MGE.

The two searches break down as follows:

 1) Model the lens galaxy mass as an `Isothermal`  and first source galaxy using an MGE.
 2) Model the lens, first and second source galaxies, where the first source's mass is an `IsothermalSph` and second
  source is an MGE.

__Why Chain?__

Systems with two (or more) strongly lensed sources are a great example of the benefits of search chaining. The lens
model can quickly have many parameters (e.g. N > 20), but many of the components being fitted are only mildly covariant
with one another.

Most importantly, ray-tracing of the first source galaxy does not depend on the properties of the second source galaxy
at all, meaning it can be used to initialize the lens mass model before the second source is fitted. For the simulated
data fitted in this example, we'll see that the first search successfully initializes the lens mass model and first
source model without issue, such that fitting of the second source can be done efficiently.

The only problem is that the light of the second source is included in the data we fit in the first search, and thus
could bias or impact its model fit. To circumvent this, the first search uses a smaller mask which removes the light
of the second source from the model-fit. A larger mask included both sources is then used in the second search.

__Preloading__

When certain components of a model are fixed its associated quantities do not change during a model-fit. For
example, for a lens model where all light profiles are fixed, the PSF blurred model-image of those light profiles
is also fixed.

**PyAutoLens** uses _implicit preloading_ to inspect the model and determine what quantities are fixed. It then stores
these in memory before the non-linear search begins such that they are not recomputed for every likelihood evaluation.

In this example no preloading occurs.

 - The first source galaxy's light is an MGE with 1 x 20 Gaussians [parameters fixed to results of search 1].

The galaxies are assigned redshifts of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0. This ensures the multi-plane ray-tracing necessary for the 
double Einstein ring lens system is performed correctly.

The lens galaxy's mass and first source galaxy's light are passed as an `instance` (as opposed to the `model` which 
was used in the API tutorial). By passing these objects as an `instance` it passes the maximum log likelihood parameters 
inferred by search 1 as fixed values that are not free parameters fitted for by the non-linear search of search 2.

__Wrap Up__

In this example, we used prior passing to initialize a model fit to a double Einstein ring. We exploited the fact that 
ray-tracing of the first source is fully independent of the source behind it, such that we could use it to initialize 
the lens model before fitting the second source.

For certain double Einstein ring systems, it is possible that the light of the first and second sources are harder to
deblend than the simple masking we used in this example. Manual masks drawn using a GUI which removes the second 
source's light will nevertheless always be possible, but more care may be required.

__Pipelines__

Advanced search chaining uses `pipelines` that chain together multiple searches to perform complex lens modeling 
in a robust and efficient way. 

There are currently no pipelines written for double Einstein ring systems, albeit one can craft them by learning the
API and concepts from existing template pipelines. We are still figuring out the most effective way to model double
Einstein ring systems, which is why pipeline templates are not yet written.

__SLaM (Source, Light and Mass)__
 
An even more advanced approach which uses search chaining are the SLaM pipelines, which break the lens modeling 
processing into a series of fits that first perfect the source model, then the lens light model and finally the lens
mass model. 

The SLaM pipelines begin with a linear parametric Source pipeline, which then switches to an inversion Source pipeline, 
exploiting the chaining technique demonstrated in this example.

Pipeline: Double Einstein Ring
==============================

By chaining together four searches this script fits `Imaging` dataset of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens, which has two source galaxies
at two different redshifts, forming a double Einstein ring system. In the final model:

 - The lens galaxy's light is an MGE.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal`.
 - The first source galaxy's mass is a `IsothermalSph` and its light is modeled using an `Inversion`.
 - The second source galaxy's light is modeled using an `Inversion`.

The three searches break down as follows:

 1) Model the lens galaxy using an MGE with 2 x 30 Gaussians to subtract its emission.
 2) Model the lens galaxy mass as an `Isothermal`  and first source galaxy using an MGE.
 3) Model the lens, first and second source galaxies, where the first source's mass is an `IsothermalSph` and second
  source is an MGE.
 4) Model the first and second source galaxy simultaneously using an `Inversion` and lens galaxy mass as an
 `Isothermal`.

The approach used in this pipeline and benefits of using chaining searching to fit double einstein ring systems are
described in the script `notebooks/imaging/chaining/double_einstein_ring.ipynb`.

inputs:

- `total_linear_light_profiles`: The number of linear light profiles in the model. This is 0 because we are not
  fitting any linear light profiles to the data, primarily because the lens light is omitted.

- `total_mapper_pixels`: The number of source pixels in the rectangular pixelization mesh. This is required to set up 
  the arrays that perform the linear algebra of the pixelization.

- `source_pixel_zeroed_indices`: The indices of source pixels on its edge, which when the source is reconstructed 
  are forced to values of zero, a technique tests have shown are required to give accruate lens models.

The `image_mesh` can be ignored, it is legacy API from previous versions which may or may not be reintegrated in future

__Wrap Up__

In this example, we passed used prior passing to initialize a model fit to a double Einstein ring using 
two `Inversion`'s.

Fitting just the `Inversion` by itself for a double Einstein ring system is practically impossible, due to the 
unphysical solutions which reconstruct its light as a demagnified version of each source. Furthermore, it helped to 
ensure that the model-fit ran efficiently.

__Pipelines__

Advanced search chaining uses `pipelines` that chain together multiple searches to perform complex lens modeling 
in a robust and efficient way. 

There are currently no pipelines written for double Einstein ring systems, albeit one can craft them by learning the
API and concepts from existing template pipelines. We are still figuring out the most effective way to model double
Einstein ring systems, which is why pipeline templates are not yet written.

__SLaM (Source, Light and Mass)__

An even more advanced approach which uses search chaining are the SLaM pipelines, which break the lens modeling 
processing into a series of fits that first perfect the source model, then the lens light model and finally the lens
mass model. 

The SLaM pipelines begin with a parametric Source pipeline, which then switches to an inversion Source pipeline, 
exploiting the chaining technique demonstrated in this example.
