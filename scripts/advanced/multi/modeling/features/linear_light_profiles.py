Modeling: Linear Light Profiles
===============================

A "linear light profile" is a variant of a standard light profile where the `intensity` parameter is solved for
via linear algebra every time the model is fitted to the data. This uses a process called an "inversion" and it
always computes the `intensity` values that give the best fit to the data (e.g. maximize the likelihood)
given the light profile's other parameters.

Linear light profiles are described in
the `autolens_workspace/notebooks/modeling/imaging/features/light_light_profiles.ipynb` example, and if you have
not read this you should go through this example first.

This script illustrates their application in the context of multi-wavelength lens modeling.

__Advantages__

The brightness of a galaxy varies significantly across different wavebands, and in most example scripts we have
seen that the `intensity` parameter of the lens and source galaxies is made an additional free parameter in the
model-fit.

Therefore, every time we add a new dataset to our analysis, we increase the dimensionality of non-linear parameter
by at least 1 parameter per galaxy. This can make the model-fit slower and take longer to converge.

Linear light profiles completely remove this problem, because all `intensity` values are computed via linear algebra
and therefore are not non-linear parameters. The dimensionality of the non-linear parameter space therefore does
not increase as we add more datasets.

__Positive Only Solver__

Many codes which use linear algebra typically rely on a linear algabra solver which allows for positive and negative
values of the solution (e.g. `np.linalg.solve`), because they are computationally fast.

This is problematic, as it means that negative surface brightnesses values can be computed to represent a galaxy's
light, which is clearly unphysical.

**PyAutoLens** uses a positive only linear algebra solver which has been extensively optimized to ensure it is as fast
as positive-negative solvers. This ensures that all light profile intensities are positive and therefore physical.

__Model__

This script fits a multi-wavelength `Imaging` dataset of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens with a model where:

 - The lens galaxy's light is a parametric linear `Sersic` bulge where the `intensity` varies across wavelength.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear`.
 - The source galaxy's light is a parametric linear `Sersic` where the `intensity` varies across wavelength.

Two images are fitted, corresponding to a greener ('g' band) redder image (`r` band).

This is an advanced script and assumes previous knowledge of the core **PyAutoLens** API for lens modeling. Thus,
certain parts of code are not documented to ensure the script is concise.

__Colors__

The colors of the multi-wavelength image, which in this case are green (g-band) and red (r-band).

The strings are used for load each dataset.

__Pixel Scales__

Every multi-wavelength dataset can have its own unique pixel-scale.

"""
__Dataset__

Load and plot each multi-wavelength strong lens dataset, using a list of their waveband colors.

"""
__Mask__

Define a 3.0" circular mask, which includes the emission of the lens and source galaxies.

For multi-wavelength lens modeling, we use the same mask for every dataset whenever possible. This is not
absolutely necessary, but provides a more reliable analysis.

__Analysis__

We create an `Analysis` object for every dataset.
"""

"""
Sum the analyses to create an overall analysis object, which sums the `log_likelihood_function` of each dataset
and returns the overall likelihood of the model fit to the dataset.
"""
analysis = sum(analysis_list)

"""
We can parallelize the likelihood function of these analysis classes, whereby each evaluation is performed on a 
different CPU.
"""

"""
__Model__

We compose a lens model where:

 - The lens galaxy's light is a linear parametric `Sersic`, where the `intensity` parameter of the lens galaxy
 for each individual waveband is solved for linearly independently in each waveband [6 parameters].

 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear` [7 parameters].
 
 - The source galaxy's light is a linear parametric `Sersic`, where the `intensity` parameter of the lens galaxy
 for each individual waveband is solved for linearly independently in each waveband [6 parameters].

The number of free parameters and therefore the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space is N=19.

A dimensionality of N=19 is 4 parameters less than the dimensionality of N=23 we would have if we used standard
light profiles with the `intensity` of the lens and source galaxies as free parameters in the model-fit.

__Result__

The result object returned by this model-fit is a list of `Result` objects, because we used a combined analysis.
Each result corresponds to each analysis, and therefore corresponds to the model-fit at that wavelength.

For example, close inspection of the `max_log_likelihood_instance` of the two results shows that all parameters,
except the `intensity` of the source galaxy's `bulge`, are identical.

Plotting each result's tracer shows that the source appears different, owning to its different intensities.

The `Samples` object still has the dimensions of the overall non-linear search (in this case N=15). 

Therefore, the samples is identical in every result object.
