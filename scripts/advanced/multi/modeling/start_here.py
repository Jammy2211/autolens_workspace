Modeling: Mass Total + Source Parametric
========================================

This script fits a multi-wavelength `Imaging` dataset of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens with a model where:

 - The lens galaxy's light is a linear parametric `Sersic` bulge where the `intensity` varies across wavelength.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear`.
 - The source galaxy's light is a linear parametric `SersicCore` where the `intensity` varies across wavelength.

Two images are fitted, corresponding to a greener ('g' band) redder image (`r` band).

This is an advanced script and assumes previous knowledge of the core **PyAutoLens** API for lens modeling. Thus,
certain parts of code are not documented to ensure the script is concise.

__Mask__

Define a 3.0" circular mask, which includes the emission of the lens and source galaxies.

For multi-wavelength lens modeling, we use the same mask for every dataset whenever possible. This is not
absolutely necessary, but provides a more reliable analysis.

__Analysis__

We create an `Analysis` object for every dataset.
"""
analysis_list = [al.AnalysisImaging(dataset=dataset) for dataset in dataset_list]

"""
By summing this list of analysis objects, we create an overall `CombinedAnalysis` which we can use to fit the 
multi-wavelength imaging data, where:

 - The log likelihood function of this summed analysis class is the sum of the log likelihood functions of each 
 individual analysis objects (e.g. the fit to each separate waveband).

 - The summing process ensures that tasks such as outputting results to hard-disk, visualization, etc use a 
 structure that separates each analysis and therefore each dataset.
 
 - Next, we will use this combined analysis to parameterize a model where certain lens parameters vary across
 the dataset.
"""
analysis = sum(analysis_list)

"""
We can parallelize the likelihood function of these analysis classes, whereby each evaluation is performed on a 
different CPU.
"""
analysis.n_cores = 1

"""
__Model__

We compose a lens model where:

 - The lens galaxy's light is a linear parametric `Sersic`, where the `intensity` parameter of the lens galaxy
 for each individual waveband of imaging is a different free parameter [8 parameters].

 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear` [7 parameters].
 
 - The source galaxy's light is a linear parametric `SersicCore`, where the `intensity` parameter of the source galaxy
 for each individual waveband of imaging is a different free parameter [8 parameters].

The number of free parameters and therefore the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space is N=23.

__Linear Light Profiles__

The model below uses a `linear light profile` for the bulge and disk, via the API `lp_linear`. This is a specific type 
of light profile that solves for the `intensity` of each profile that best fits the data via a linear inversion. 
This means it is not a free parameter, reducing the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space. 

Linear light profiles significantly improve the speed, accuracy and reliability of modeling and they are used
by default in every modeling example. A full description of linear light profiles is provided in the
`autolens_workspace/*/modeling/imaging/features/linear_light_profiles.py` example.

A standard light profile can be used if you change the `lp_linear` to `lp`, but it is not recommended.

For multi wavelength dataset modeling, the `lp_linear` API is extremely powerful as the `intensity` varies across
the datasets, meaning that making it linear reduces the dimensionality of parameter space significantly.
"""
lens = af.Model(
    al.Galaxy,
    redshift=0.5,
    bulge=al.lp_linear.Sersic,
    mass=al.mp.Isothermal,
    shear=al.mp.ExternalShear,
)
source = af.Model(al.Galaxy, redshift=1.0, bulge=al.lp_linear.SersicCore)

model = af.Collection(galaxies=af.Collection(lens=lens, source=source))

"""
Galaxies change appearance across wavelength, with the most significant change in their brightness.

Models applied to summed analyses can be extended to include free parameters specific to each dataset. In this example,
we want the lens and source effective radii to vary across the g and r-band datasets.

The API for doing this is shown below, where by inputting the `effective_radius` model parameters to the `with_free_parameter` 
method the effective_radius of the lens's bulge and source's bulge become free parameters across every analysis object.

NOTE: Other aspects of galaxies may vary across wavelength, none of which are included in this example. The API below 
can easily be extended to include these additional parameters, and the `features` package explains other tools for 
extending the model across datasets.

"""
__Result__

The result object returned by this model-fit is a list of `Result` objects, because we used a combined analysis.
Each result corresponds to each analysis, and therefore corresponds to the model-fit at that wavelength.

For example, close inspection of the `max_log_likelihood_instance` of the two results shows that all parameters,
except the `effective_radius` of the source galaxy's `bulge`, are identical.
"""

Plotting each result's tracer shows that the source appears different, owning to its different intensities.

The `Samples` object still has the dimensions of the overall non-linear search (in this case N=15). 

Therefore, the samples is identical in every result object.
