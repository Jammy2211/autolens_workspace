The ``chaining`` folder contains examples scripts illustrating the non-linear search chaining feature for multiple imaging datasets.

Notes
-----

The ``multi`` extends the ``imaging`` package and readers should refer to the ``imaging`` package for more examples
of how to perform search chaining.
