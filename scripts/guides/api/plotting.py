Plotting
========

If you are looking for a description of how to customize the appearance of plots, for example:

- Changing the matplotlib color map and settings so they display images in your preferred style.
- Controlling what visuals (e.g. the mask, critical curves, etc.) are plotted on figures.
- Other advanced plotting settings and customizations.

Go to the `autolens_workspace/*/plot` package, and start by reading the `start_here.ipynb` example.
This will give you an overview of the plotting tools available, how to customize them, and guide you to other plotting
examples which you may find useful!
