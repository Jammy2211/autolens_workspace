The ``double_einstein_ring`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis of double source-plane
strong lenses (DSPLs).

DSPLs are where two source galaxies, at two different redshifts, are observed in addition to the foreground lens
galaxies and they are often used to measure Cosmological parameters.

Files
-----

The following example scripts illustrating lens modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Lens modeling of DSPL strong lenses.
- ``simulator``: Simulating a DSPL strong lens system.
- ``chaining``: Using non-linear search chaining to fit a DSPL, which fits the first source followed by the second for efficient and robust modeling.

Results
-------

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/guides/results``.
