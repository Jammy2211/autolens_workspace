The ``mass_stellar_dark`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis using lens models
which decompose the lens mass into its stars and dark matter.

Files
-----

The following example scripts illustrating lens modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Lens modeling using decomposed stars and dark matter models.
- ``simulator``: Simulate a strong lens using a stars plus dark matter model.
- ``chaining``: Using non-linear search chaining to fit a stars plus dark matter model, for efficient and robust modeling.
- ``slam``: Using the Source, Light and Mass (SLAM) pipeline to perform lens modeling with stars plus dark matter mass models.

Results
-------

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/results``.
