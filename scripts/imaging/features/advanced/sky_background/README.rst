The ``sky_background`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis which includes the sky background
level in the data and model.

Files
-----

The following example scripts illustrating lens modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Lens modeling including the sky background.
- ``simulator``: Simulating strong lens data where the sky background has not been subtracted.
- ``fit``: Fit data with the sky background included and compute quantities like the residuals, chi squared and likelihood.


Results
-------

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/results``.
