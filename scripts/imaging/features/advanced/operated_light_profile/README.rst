The ``operated_light_profile`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis using operated light
profiles, which represent the light of galaxies after PSF convolution.

The following example scripts illustrating lens modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Lens modeling using operated light profiles.
- ``simulator``: Simulating a strong lens using operated light profiles.

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/guides/results``.
