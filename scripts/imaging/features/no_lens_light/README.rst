The ``no_lens_light`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis of data without observed lens light.

Files
-----

The following example scripts illustrating lens modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Lens modeling of data with no observed lens light.
- ``simulator``: Simulating strong lens data without lens light.
- ``slam``: Use the Source, Light and Mass (SLAM) pipeline to perform lens modeling without lens light.

Results
-------

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/results``.
