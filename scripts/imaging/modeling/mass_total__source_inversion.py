"""
Modeling: Mass Total + Source Inversion
=======================================

This script  fits `Imaging` dataset of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens with a model where:

 - The lens galaxy's light is omitted (and is not present in the simulated data).
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `EllIsothermal` and `ExternalShear`.
 - The source galaxy's surface-brightness is an `Inversion`.

An `Inversion` reconstructs the source's light using a pixel-grid, which is regularized using a prior that forces
this reconstruction to be smooth. This uses `Pixelization` and `Regularization` objects and in this example we will
use their simplest forms, a `Rectangular` `Pixelization` and `Constant` `Regularization`.scheme.

Inversions are covered in detail in chapter 4 of the **HowToLens** lectures.

__A NOTE OF CAUTION__

A common issue with `Inversions` is that they...

"""
__Dataset__

Load and plot the strong lens dataset `mass_sie__source_sersic` via .fits files, which we will fit with the lens model.
"""
dataset_name = "mass_sie__source_sersic"
dataset_path = path.join("dataset", "imaging", "no_lens_light", dataset_name)

imaging = al.Imaging.from_fits(
    image_path=path.join(dataset_path, "image.fits"),
    psf_path=path.join(dataset_path, "psf.fits"),
    noise_map_path=path.join(dataset_path, "noise_map.fits"),
    pixel_scales=0.1,
)

imaging_plotter = aplt.ImagingPlotter(imaging=imaging)
imaging_plotter.subplot_imaging()

"""
__Masking__

The model-fit requires a `Mask2D` defining the regions of the image we fit the lens model to the data, which we define
and use to set up the `Imaging` object that the lens model fits.
"""
mask = al.Mask2D.circular(
    shape_native=imaging.shape_native, pixel_scales=imaging.pixel_scales, radius=3.0
)

imaging = imaging.apply_mask(mask=mask)

imaging_plotter = aplt.ImagingPlotter(imaging=imaging)
imaging_plotter.subplot_imaging()

"""
__Positions__

This fit also uses the arc-second positions of the multiply imaged lensed source galaxy, which were drawn onto the
image via the GUI described in the file `autolens_workspace/notebooks/imaging/preprocess/gui/positions.py`.
"""
positions = al.Grid2DIrregular.from_json(
    file_path=path.join(dataset_path, "positions.json")
)

"""
__Model__

We compose our lens model using `Model` objects, which represent the galaxies we fit to our data.  In this 
example we fit a lens model where:

 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `EllIsothermal` and `ExternalShear` [7 parameters].
 
 - The source-galaxy's light uses a `Rectangular` pixelization with fixed resolution 30 x 30 pixels (0 parameters).
 
 - This pixelization is regularized using a `Constant` scheme which smooths every source pixel equally [1 parameter]. 

The number of free parameters and therefore the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space is N=6. 
 
It is worth noting the `Pixelization` and `Regularization` use significantly fewer parameters (1 parameter) than 
fitting the source using `LightProfile`'s (7+ parameters). 

NOTE: 

**PyAutoLens** assumes that the lens galaxy centre is near the coordinates (0.0", 0.0"). 

If for your dataset the  lens is not centred at (0.0", 0.0"), we recommend that you either: 

 - Reduce your data so that the centre is (`autolens_workspace/notebooks/preprocess`). 
 - Manually override the lens model priors (`autolens_workspace/notebooks/imaging/modeling/customize/priors.py`).
"""
lens = af.Model(
    al.Galaxy, redshift=0.5, mass=al.mp.EllIsothermal, shear=al.mp.ExternalShear
)
source = af.Model(
    al.Galaxy,
    redshift=1.0,
    pixelization=al.pix.Rectangular(shape=(30, 30)),
    regularization=al.reg.Constant,
)

model = af.Collection(galaxies=af.Collection(lens=lens, source=source))

"""
__Search__

The lens model is fitted to the data using a non-linear search. In this example, we use the nested sampling algorithm 
Dynesty (https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The folder `autolens_workspace/notebooks/imaging/modeling/customize/non_linear_searches` gives an overview of the 
non-linear searches **PyAutoLens** supports. If you are unclear of what a non-linear search is, checkout chapter 2 of 
the **HowToLens** lectures.

The `name` and `path_prefix` below specify the path where results ae stored in the output folder:  

 `/autolens_workspace/output/imaging/modeling/mass_sie__source_sersic/mass[sie]_source[inversion]/unique_identifier`.
 
__Unique Identifier__

In the path above, the `unique_identifier` appears as a collection of characters, where this identifier is generated 
based on the model, search and dataset that are used in the fit.
 
An identical combination of model and search generates the same identifier, meaning that rerunning the script will use 
the existing results to resume the model-fit. In contrast, if you change the model or search, a new unique identifier 
will be generated, ensuring that the model-fit results are output into a separate folder.

We additionally want the unique identifier to be specific to the dataset fitted, so that if we fit different datasets
with the same model and search results are output to a different folder. We achieve this below by passing 
the `dataset_name` to the search's `unique_tag`.

__Number Of Cores__

We include an input `number_of_cores`, which when above 1 means that Dynesty uses parallel processing to sample multiple 
lens models at once on your CPU. When `number_of_cores=2` the search will run roughly two times as
fast, for `number_of_cores=3` three times as fast, and so on. The downside is more cores on your CPU will be in-use
which may hurt the general performance of your computer.

You should experiment to figure out the highest value which does not give a noticeable loss in performance of your 
computer. If you know that your processor is a quad-core process you should be able to use `number_of_cores=4`. For 
users on a Windows Operating system, using `number_of_cores>1` may lead to an error, in which case it should be 
reduced back to 1 to fix it.
"""
search = af.DynestyStatic(
    path_prefix=path.join("imaging", "modeling"),
    name="mass[sie]_source[inversion]",
    unique_tag=dataset_name,
    nlive=50,
    number_of_cores=1,
)

"""
__Analysis__

The `AnalysisImaging` object defines the `log_likelihood_function` used by the non-linear search to fit the model to 
the `Imaging`dataset. 

_Position Thresholding:_

Unlike other example scripts, we also pass the `AnalysisImaging` object below the positions we loaded above, alongside 
a `SettingsLens` object with a `positions_threshold`.

This is because `Inversion`'s suffer a bias whereby they fit unphysical lens models where the source galaxy is 
reconstructed as a demagnified version of the lensed source. These are covered in more detail in chapter 4 
of **HowToLens**. 

To prevent these solutions biasing the model-fit we specify a `position_threshold` of 0.5", which requires that a 
mass model traces the four (y,x) coordinates specified by our positions (that correspond to the brightest regions of the 
lensed source) within 0.5" of one another in the source-plane, else the mass model is discarded and a new 
model is sampled. This removes the unphysical solutions that bias an `Inversion`. 

The threshold of 0.5" is large. For an accurate lens model we would anticipate the positions trace within < 0.01" of
one another. However, we only want the threshold to aid the non-linear with the choice of mass model, but not risk 
removing genuinely physical models.

Position thresholding is described in more detail in the 
script `autolens_workspace/notebooks/imaging/modeling/customize/positions.py`

    dataset=imaging,

    settings_lens=al.SettingsLens(positions_threshold=0.5),
)

"""
__Model-Fit__

We can now begin the model-fit by passing the model and analysis object to the search, which performs a non-linear
search to find which models fit the data with the highest likelihood.

Checkout the output folder for live outputs of the results of the fit, including on-the-fly visualization of the best 
fit model!

result = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

"""
__Result__

The search returns a result object, which includes: 

 - The lens model corresponding to the maximum log likelihood solution in parameter space.
 - The corresponding maximum log likelihood `Tracer` and `FitImaging` objects.
 - Information on the posterior as estimated by the `Dynesty` non-linear search.
