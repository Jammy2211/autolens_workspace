The ``log_likelihood_function`` folder contains example scripts showing step-by-step visual guides to how likelihoods
are evaluated.

Folders (Advanced)
------------------

- ``light profile``: The likelihood function of a light profile fit, which uses an elliptical Sersic to represent the galaxy.
- ``pixelization``: The likelihood function of a pixelized reconstruction, which uses a regularized pixelization to reconstruct the galaxy.
