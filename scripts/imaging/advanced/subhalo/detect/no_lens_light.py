SLaM (Source, Light and Mass): Subhalo Detect No Lens Light
===========================================================

SLaM pipelines break the analysis of 'galaxy-scale' strong lenses down into multiple pipelines which focus on modeling
a specific aspect of the strong lens, first the Source, then the (lens) Light and finally the Mass. Each of these
pipelines has it own inputs which customize the model and analysis in that pipeline.

The models fitted in earlier pipelines determine the model used in later pipelines. For example, if the SOURCE PIPELINE
uses a parametric `Sersic` profile for the bulge, this will be used in the subsequent MASS TOTAL PIPELINE.

Using a SOURCE LP PIPELINE, MASS TOTAL PIPELINE and SUBHALO PIPELINE this SLaM script  fits `Imaging` dataset
of a strong lens system, where in the final model:

 - The lens galaxy's light is omitted from the data and model.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal`.
 - A dark matter subhalo near The lens galaxy mass is included as a`NFWMCRLudlowSph`.
 - The source galaxy is an `Sersic`.

This uses the SLaM pipelines:

 `source_lp`
 `mass_total`
 `subhalo/detection`

"""
__SOURCE LP PIPELINE__

The SOURCE LP PIPELINE uses one search to initialize a robust model for the source galaxy's light, which in
this example:

 - Uses a parametric `Sersic` bulge for the source's light.
 - Uses an `Isothermal` model for the lens's total mass distribution with an `ExternalShear`.
 
 __Settings__:
 
 - Mass Centre: Fix the mass profile centre to (0.0, 0.0) (this assumption will be relaxed in the MASS TOTAL PIPELINE).

"""
__MASS TOTAL PIPELINE__

The MASS TOTAL PIPELINE uses one search to fits a complex lens mass model to a high level of accuracy, 
using the lens mass model and source model of the SOURCE PIPELINE to initialize the model priors. In this example it:

 - Uses an `PowerLaw` model for the lens's total mass distribution [The centre if unfixed from (0.0, 0.0)].
 - Uses the `Sersic` model representing a bulge for the source's light.
 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PIPELINE through to the MASS TOTAL PIPELINE.

"""
__SUBHALO PIPELINE (single plane detection)__

The SUBHALO PIPELINE (single plane detection) consists of the following searches:
 
 1) Refit the lens and source model, to refine the model evidence for comparing to the models fitted which include a 
 subhalo. This uses the same model as fitted in the MASS TOTAL PIPELINE. 
 2) Performs a grid-search of non-linear searches to attempt to detect a dark matter subhalo. 
 3) If there is a successful detection a final search is performed to refine its parameters.
 
For this modeling script the SUBHALO PIPELINE customizes:

 - The [number_of_steps x number_of_steps] size of the grid-search, as well as the dimensions it spans in arc-seconds.
 - The `number_of_cores` used for the gridsearch, where `number_of_cores > 1` performs the model-fits in paralle using
 the Python multiprocessing module.
