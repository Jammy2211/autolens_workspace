SLaM (Source, Light and Mass): Source Light Pixelized + Light Profile + Mass Total + Subhalo NFW
================================================================================================

SLaM pipelines break the analysis of 'galaxy-scale' strong lenses down into multiple pipelines which focus on modeling
a specific aspect of the strong lens, first the Source, then the (lens) Light and finally the Mass. Each of these
pipelines has it own inputs which which customize the model and analysis in that pipeline.

The models fitted in earlier pipelines determine the model used in later pipelines. For example, if the SOURCE PIPELINE
uses a parametric `Sersic` profile for the bulge, this will be used in the subsequent MASS TOTAL PIPELINE.

Using a SOURCE LP PIPELINE, LIGHT LP PIPELINE, MASS TOTAL PIPELINE and SUBHALO PIPELINE this SLaM script
fits `Imaging` of a strong lens system, where in the final model:

 - The lens galaxy's light is a bulge with a parametric `Sersic` light profile.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal`.
 - A dark matter subhalo near The lens galaxy mass is included as a`NFWMCRLudlowSph`.
 - The source galaxy is an `Inversion`.

This uses the SLaM pipelines:

 `source_lp`
 `source__pixelization`
 `light_lp`
 `mass_total`
 `subhalo/detection`

__SOURCE LP PIPELINE (with lens light)__

The SOURCE LP PIPELINE (with lens light) uses three searches to initialize a robust model for the 
source galaxy's light, which in this example:
 
 - Uses a parametric `Sersic` bulge for the lens galaxy's light.
 
 - Uses an `Isothermal` model for the lens's total mass distribution with an `ExternalShear`.

 __Settings__:

 - Mass Centre: Fix the mass profile centre to (0.0, 0.0) (this assumption will be relaxed in the MASS TOTAL PIPELINE).

"""
__SOURCE PIX PIPELINE (with lens light)__

The SOURCE PIX PIPELINE (with lens light) uses four searches to initialize a robust model for the `Inversion` 
that reconstructs the source galaxy's light. It begins by fitting a `DelaunayMagnification` mesh with `Constant` 
regularization, to set up the model and hyper images, and then:

 - Uses a `DelaunayBrightnessImage` pixelization.
 - Uses an `AdaptiveBrightness` regularization.
 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE LP PIPELINE through to the
 SOURCE PIX PIPELINE.

__Settings__:

 - Positions: We update the positions and positions threshold using the previous model-fitting result (as described 
 in `chaining/examples/parametric_to_pixelization.py`) to remove unphysical solutions from the `Inversion` model-fitting.

"""
__LIGHT LP PIPELINE__

The LIGHT LP PIPELINE uses one search to fit a complex lens light model to a high level of accuracy, using the
lens mass model and source light model fixed to the maximum log likelihood result of the SOURCE PIX PIPELINE.
In this example it:

 - Uses a parametric `Sersic` bulge for the lens galaxy's light [Do not use the results of the SOURCE LP PIPELINE 
 to initialize priors].

 - Uses an `Isothermal` model for the lens's total mass distribution [fixed from SOURCE PIX PIPELINE].

 - Uses an `Inversion` for the source's light [priors fixed from SOURCE PIX PIPELINE].

 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PIPELINE through to the MASS 
 PIPELINE [fixed values].

"""
__MASS TOTAL PIPELINE (with lens light)__

The MASS TOTAL PIPELINE (with lens light) uses one search to fits a complex lens mass model to a high level of accuracy, 
using the lens mass model and source model of the SOURCE PIPELINE to initialize the model priors and the lens light
model of the LIGHT LP PIPELINE. In this example it:

 - Uses a parametric `Sersic` bulge for the lens galaxy's light [fixed from LIGHT LP PIPELINE].

 - Uses an `PowerLaw` model for the lens's total mass distribution [priors initialized from SOURCE 
 PARAMETRIC PIPELINE + centre unfixed from (0.0, 0.0)].
 
 - Uses the `Sersic` model representing a bulge for the source's light [priors initialized from SOURCE 
 PARAMETRIC PIPELINE].
 
 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PIPELINE through to the MASS TOTAL 
 PIPELINE.

"""
__SUBHALO PIPELINE (single plane detection)__

The SUBHALO PIPELINE (single plane detection) consists of the following searches:
 
 1) Refit the lens and source model, to refine the model evidence for comparing to the models fitted which include a 
 subhalo. This uses the same model as fitted in the MASS TOTAL PIPELINE. 
 2) Performs a grid-search of non-linear searches to attempt to detect a dark matter subhalo. 
 3) If there is a successful detection a final search is performed to refine its parameters.
 
For this modeling script the SUBHALO PIPELINE customizes:

 - The [number_of_steps x number_of_steps] size of the grid-search, as well as the dimensions it spans in arc-seconds.
 - The `number_of_cores` used for the gridsearch, where `number_of_cores > 1` performs the model-fits in paralle using
 the Python multiprocessing module.
