"""
SLaM (Source, Light and Mass): No Lens Light
============================================

This example shows how to use the SLaM pipelines to fit a lens where the lens light is not present in the data.
This means that the LIGHT PIPELINE is omitted from the pipeline completely.

__Model__

Using a SOURCE LP PIPELINE, SOURCE PIX PIPELINE and a MASS TOTAL PIPELINE this SLaM script fits `Imaging`
of a strong lens system, where in the final model:

 - The lens galaxy's light is omitted from the data and model.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `PowerLaw`.
 - The source galaxy is reconstructed using a `Hilbert` image-mesh, `Delaunay` mesh and `ConstantSplit` 
   regularization scheme.

This uses the SLaM pipelines:

 `source_lp`
 `source_pix`
 `mass_total`

__SOURCE LP PIPELINE__

The SOURCE LP PIPELINE uses one search to initialize a robust model for the source galaxy's light, which in
this example:

 - Uses a parametric `Sersic` bulge for the source's light.
 - Uses an `Isothermal` model for the lens's total mass distribution with an `ExternalShear`.
 
__Settings__:
 
 - Mass Centre: Fix the mass profile centre to (0.0, 0.0) (this assumption will be relaxed in the SOURCE INVERSION 
 PIPELINE).

    mass_centre=(0.0, 0.0),
    redshift_lens=0.5,
    redshift_source=1.0,
)


"""
__SOURCE PIX PIPELINE__

The SOURCE PIX PIPELINE uses two searches to initialize a robust model for the `Pixelization` that
reconstructs the source galaxy's light. 

This pixelization adapts its source pixels to the morphology of the source, placing more pixels in its 
brightest regions. To do this, an "adapt image" is required, which is the lens light subtracted image meaning
only the lensed source emission is present.

The SOURCE LP Pipeline result is not good enough quality to set up this adapt image (e.g. the source
may be more complex than a simple light profile). The first step of the SOURCE PIX PIPELINE therefore fits a new
model using a pixelization to create this adapt image.

The first search, which is an initialization search, fits an `Overlay` image-mesh, `Delaunay` mesh 
and `AdaptiveBrightnessSplit` regularization.

__Adapt Images / Image Mesh Settings__

If you are unclear what the `adapt_images` and `SettingsInversion` inputs are doing below, refer to the 
`autolens_workspace/*/imaging/advanced/chaining/pix_adapt/start_here.py` example script.

__Settings__:

 - Positions: We update the positions and positions threshold using the previous model-fitting result (as described 
 in `chaining/examples/parametric_to_pixelization.py`) to remove unphysical solutions from the `Inversion` model-fitting.

"""
__SOURCE PIX PIPELINE 2 (with lens light)__

The second search, which uses the mesh and regularization used throughout the remainder of the SLaM pipelines,
fits the following model:

- Uses a `Hilbert` image-mesh. 

- Uses a `Delaunay` mesh.

 - Uses an `AdaptiveBrightness` regularization.

 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE LP PIPELINE through to the
 SOURCE PIX PIPELINE.

The `Hilbert` image-mesh and `AdaptiveBrightness` regularization adapt the source pixels and regularization weights
to the source's morphology.

Below, we therefore set up the adapt image using this result.

"""
__MASS TOTAL PIPELINE__

The MASS TOTAL PIPELINE uses one search to fits a complex lens mass model to a high level of accuracy, 
using the lens mass model and source model of the SOURCE PIX PIPELINE to initialize the model priors. 

In this example it:

 - Uses an `PowerLaw` model for the lens's total mass distribution [The centre if unfixed from (0.0, 0.0)].
 - Uses a `Pixelization` for the source's light [fixed from SOURCE PIX PIPELINE].
 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PIPELINES through to the MASS 
 PIPELINE.
 
__Settings__:

 - adapt: We may be using adapt features and therefore pass the result of the SOURCE PIX PIPELINE to use as the
 hyper dataset if required.

 - Positions: We update the positions and positions threshold using the previous model-fitting result (as described 
 in `chaining/examples/parametric_to_pixelization.py`) to remove unphysical solutions from the `Inversion` model-fitting.
