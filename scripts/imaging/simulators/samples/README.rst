The ``sample`` folder contains example scripts for simulating imaging datasets (E.g. Hubble Space Telescope)
consisting of large samples of strong lenses.

This is done by creating a model of the sample's overall population parameters and drawing lens model parameters
from these prior distributions.

These scripts simulate samples of strong lenses consisting of:

- ``simple.py``: Simple strong lenses where the light is a Sersic, mass an isothermal and source a Sersic..
- ``no_lens_light.py__mass_Sis``: Lenses without lens light where the mass is a spherical isothermal total mass profile.
