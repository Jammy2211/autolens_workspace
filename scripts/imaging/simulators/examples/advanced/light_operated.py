"""
Simulator: Light Operated
=========================

It is common for galaxies to have point-source emission, for example bright emission right at their centre due to
an active galactic nuclei or a compact knot of star formation.

This point-source emission is subject to blurring during data acquisition due to the telescope optics, and therefore
is not seen as a single pixel of light but spread over multiple pixels as a convolution with the telescope
Point Spread Function (PSF).

This script simulate an `Imaging` dataset of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens which has this point-source emission in
its centre. This emission uses an operated `Gaussian` light profile, which therefore is already convolved with the
PSF.

This dataset is used in `modeling/features/operated_light_profiles.py` to demonstrate how to fit this point-source
emission using an operated light profile.

__Model__

This script simulates `Imaging` of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens where:

 - The lens galaxy's light profile is an `Sersic` bulge.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear`.
 - The lens galaxy has a point source of emission at its centre which is modeled as a operated `Gaussian`.
 - The source galaxy's light is an `Sersic`.

"""
__Dataset Paths__

The `dataset_type` describes the type of data being simulated (in this case, `Imaging` data) and `dataset_name`
gives it a descriptive name. 
"""
dataset_type = "imaging"
dataset_name = "light_operated"
dataset_path = path.join("dataset", dataset_type, dataset_name)

"""
__Simulate__

Simulate the image using a `Grid2D` with the `OverSamplingIterate` object.
"""
grid = al.Grid2D.uniform(
    shape_native=(100, 100),
    pixel_scales=0.1,
    over_sampling=al.OverSamplingIterate(
        fractional_accuracy=0.9999, sub_steps=[2, 4, 8, 16]
    ),
)

"""
Simulate a simple Gaussian PSF for the image.
"""
psf = al.Kernel2D.from_gaussian(
    shape_native=(11, 11), sigma=0.1, pixel_scales=grid.pixel_scales
)

"""
Create the simulator for the imaging data, which defines the exposure time, background sky, noise levels and psf.
"""
simulator = al.SimulatorImaging(
    exposure_time=300.0, psf=psf, background_sky_level=0.1, add_poisson_noise=True
)

"""
__Ray Tracing__

Setup the lens galaxy's light, mass and source galaxy light for this simulated lens.

This includes an operated `Gaussian` component which represents the PSF convolved emission of a point-source 
emission at the galaxy's centre. 

It uses the same parameters as the `psf` defined above.

__Tracer json__

Save the `Tracer` in the dataset folder as a .json file, ensuring the true light profiles, mass profiles and galaxies
