"""
Iamging: Modeling
=================

This script is the starting point for lens modeling of CCD imaging data (E.g. Hubble Space Telescope, Euclid) with
**PyAutoLens** and it provides an overview of the lens modeling API.

__Model__

This script fits an `Imaging` dataset of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens with a model where:

 - The lens galaxy's light is a Multi Gaussian Expansion bulge.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear`.
 - The source galaxy's light is a Multi Gaussian Expansion.

This lens model is simple and computationally fast to fit, and therefore acts as a good starting point for new
users.

__Plotters__

To produce images of the data `Plotter` objects are used, which are high-level wrappers of matplotlib
code which produce high quality visualization of strong lenses.

The `PLotter` API is described in the script `autolens_workspace/*/guides/plot`.

__Simulation__

This script fits a simulated `Imaging` dataset of a strong lens, which is produced in the
script `autolens_workspace/*/imaging/simulator.py`

__Data Preparation__

The `Imaging` dataset fitted in this example confirms to a number of standard that make it suitable to be fitted in
**PyAutoLens**.

If you are intending to fit your own strong lens data, you will need to ensure it conforms to these standards, which are
described in the script `autolens_workspace/*/imaging/data_preparation/start_here.ipynb`.

import numpy as np
from pathlib import Path

import autofit as af
import autolens as al
import autolens.plot as aplt

"""
__Dataset__

Load the strong lens dataset `simple` via .fits files, which is a data format used by astronomers to store images.

The `pixel_scales` define the arc-second to pixel conversion factor of the image, which for the dataset we are using 
is 0.1" / pixel.
"""
dataset_name = "simple"
dataset_path = Path("dataset") / "imaging" / dataset_name

    data_path=dataset_path / "data.fits",
    psf_path=dataset_path / "psf.fits",
    noise_map_path=dataset_path / "noise_map.fits",
    pixel_scales=0.1,
)

"""
Use an `ImagingPlotter` the plot the data, including: 

 - `data`: The image of the strong lens.
 - `noise_map`: The noise-map of the image, which quantifies the noise in every pixel as their RMS values.
 - `psf`: The point spread function of the image, which describes the blurring of the image by the telescope optics.
 - `signal_to_noise_map`: Quantifies the signal-to-noise in every pixel.
"""
dataset_plotter = aplt.ImagingPlotter(dataset=dataset)
dataset_plotter.subplot_dataset()

"""
__Mask__

The model-fit requires a 2D mask defining the regions of the image we fit the lens model to the data. 

We create a 3.0 arcsecond circular mask and apply it to the `Imaging` object that the lens model fits.
"""
mask_radius = 3.0

mask = al.Mask2D.circular(
    shape_native=dataset.shape_native,
    pixel_scales=dataset.pixel_scales,
    radius=mask_radius,
)

dataset = dataset.apply_mask(mask=mask)

"""
If we plot the masked data, the mask removes the exterior regions of the image where there is no emission from the 
lens and lensed source galaxies.

The mask used to fit the data can be customized, as described in 
the script `autolens_workspace/*/guides/modeling/customize`
"""
dataset_plotter = aplt.ImagingPlotter(dataset=dataset)
dataset_plotter.subplot_dataset()

"""
__Over Sampling__

Over sampling is a numerical technique where the images of light profiles and galaxies are evaluated 
on a higher resolution grid than the image data to ensure the calculation is accurate. 

For lensing calculations, the high magnification regions of a lensed source galaxy require especially high levels of 
over sampling to ensure the lensed images are evaluated accurately.

For a new user, the details of over-sampling are not important, therefore just be aware that calculations either:

 (i) use adaptive over sampling for the foregorund lens's light, which ensures high accuracy across. 
 (ii) use cored light profiles for the background source galaxy, where the core ensures low levels of over-sampling 
 produce numerically accurate but fast to compute results.


Once you are more experienced, you should read up on over-sampling in more detail via 
the `autolens_workspace/*/guides/over_sampling.ipynb` notebook.
"""
over_sample_size = al.util.over_sample.over_sample_size_via_radial_bins_from(
    grid=dataset.grid,
    sub_size_list=[4, 2, 1],
    radial_list=[0.3, 0.6],
    centre_list=[(0.0, 0.0)],
)

dataset = dataset.apply_over_sampling(over_sample_size_lp=over_sample_size)

"""
The imaging subplot updates the bottom two panels to reflect the update to over sampling, which now uses a higher
values in the centre.

Whilst you may not yet understand the details of over-sampling, you can at least track it visually in the plots
and later learnt more about it in the `over_sampling.ipynb` guide.
"""
dataset_plotter = aplt.ImagingPlotter(dataset=dataset)
dataset_plotter.subplot_dataset()

"""
__Model__

In this example we compose a lens model where:

 - The lens galaxy's light is a `Sersic` bulge [7 parameters].
 
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear` [7 parameters].
 
 - The source galaxy's light is a `SersicCore` bulge [7 parameters].

The number of free parameters and therefore the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space is N=21.

__Model Composition__

The API below for composing a lens model uses the `Model` and `Collection` objects, which are imported from 
**PyAutoLens**'s parent project **PyAutoFit** 

The API is fairly self explanatory and is straight forward to extend, for example adding more light profiles
to the lens and source or using a different mass profile.

A full description of model composition is provided by the model cookbook: 

https://pyautolens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/model_cookbook.html

__Coordinates__

The model fitting default settings assume that the lens galaxy centre is near the coordinates (0.0", 0.0"). 

If for your dataset the lens is not centred at (0.0", 0.0"), we recommend that you either: 

 - Reduce your data so that the centre is (`autolens_workspace/*/data_preparation`). 
 - Manually override the lens model priors (`autolens_workspace/*/guides/modeling/customize`).

# Lens:

bulge = af.Model(al.lp.Sersic)

# Source:

# Overall Lens Model:

model = af.Collection(galaxies=af.Collection(lens=lens, source=source))

"""
The `info` attribute shows the model in a readable format.

The `info` below may not display optimally on your computer screen, for example the whitespace between parameter
names on the left and parameter priors on the right may lead them to appear across multiple lines. This is a
common issue in Jupyter notebooks.

The`info_whitespace_length` parameter in the file `config/general.yaml` in the [output] section can be changed to 
increase or decrease the amount of whitespace (The Jupyter notebook kernel will need to be reset for this change to 
appear in a notebook).
"""
print(model.info)

"""
__Improved Lens Model__

The previous model used Sérsic light profiles for the lens and source galaxies. This makes the model API concise, 
readable, and easy to follow.

However, single Sérsic profiles perform poorly for most strong lenses. Symmetric profiles (e.g. elliptical Sérsics) 
typically leave significant residuals because they cannot capture the irregular and asymmetric morphology of real 
galaxies (e.g. isophotal twists, radially varying ellipticity).

This example therefore uses a lens model that combines two features, described in detail elsewhere (but a brief 
overview is provided below):

- **Linear light profiles**  (see ``autolens_workspace/*/imaging/features/linear_light_profiles``)
- **Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) light profiles**  (see ``autolens_workspace/*/imaging/features/multi_gaussian_expansion``)

These features avoid wasted effort trying to fit Sérsic profiles to complex data, which is likely to fail unless the 
lens is extremely simple. This does mean the model composition is more complex and as a user its a steeper learning
curve to understand the API, but its worth it for the improved accuracy and speed of lens modeling.

__Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE)__

A Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) decomposes the lens and source light into ~50–100 Gaussians with varying ellipticities 
and sizes. An MGE captures irregular features far more effectively than Sérsic profiles, leading to more accurate lens m
odels.

Remarkably, modeling with MGEs is also significantly faster than using Sérsics: they remain efficient in JAX (on CPU 
or GPU), require fewer non-linear parameters despite their flexibility, and yield simpler parameter spaces that
sample in far fewer iterations. 

__Linear Light Profiles__

The MGE model below uses a **linear light profile** for the bulge and disk via the ``lp_linear`` API, instead of the 
standard ``lp`` light profiles used above.

A linear light profile solves for the *intensity* of each component via a linear inversion, rather than treating it as 
a free parameter. This reduces the dimensionality of the non-linear parameter space: a model with ~80 Gaussians
does not introduce ~80 additional free parameters.

Linear light profiles therefore improve speed and accuracy, and they are used by default in all modeling example.

__Concise API__

The MGE model composition API is quite long and technical, so we simply load the MGE models for the lens and source 
below via a utility function `mge_model_from` which hides the API to make the code in this introduction example ready 
to read. We then use the PyAutoLens Model API to compose the over lens model.

The full MGE composition API is given in the `features/multi_gaussian_expansion` package.

model = af.Collection(galaxies=af.Collection(lens=lens, source=source))

"""
Printing the model info confirms the model has Gaussians for both the lens and source galaxies.
"""
print(model.info)

"""
__Search__

The lens model is fitted to the data using a non-linear search. 

All examples in the autolens workspace use the nested sampling algorithm 
Nautilus (https://nautilus-sampler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which extensive testing has revealed gives the most 
accurate and efficient modeling results.

Nautilus has one main setting that trades-off accuracy and computational run-time, the number of `live_points`. 
A higher number of live points gives a more accurate result, but increases the run-time. A lower value give 
less reliable lens modeling (e.g. the fit may infer a local maxima), but is faster. 

The suitable value depends on the model complexity whereby models with more parameters require more live points. 
The default value of 200 is sufficient for the vast majority of common lens models. Lower values often given reliable
results though, and speed up the run-times. In this example, given the model is quite simple (N=21 parameters), we 
reduce the number of live points to 100 to speed up the run-time.

__Unique Identifier__

In the path above, the `unique_identifier` appears as a collection of characters, where this identifier is generated 
based on the model, search and dataset that are used in the fit.
 
An identical combination of model and search generates the same identifier, meaning that rerunning the script will use 
the existing results to resume the model-fit. In contrast, if you change the model or search, a new unique identifier 
will be generated, ensuring that the model-fit results are output into a separate folder.

We additionally want the unique identifier to be specific to the dataset fitted, so that if we fit different datasets
with the same model and search results are output to a different folder. We achieve this below by passing 
the `dataset_name` to the search's `unique_tag`.

__Iterations Per Update__

Every `iterations_per_quick_update`, the non-linear search outputs the maximum likelihood model and its best fit 
image to the Jupyter Notebook display and to hard-disk.

This process takes around ~10 seconds, so we don't want it to happen too often so as to slow down the overall
fit, but we also want it to happen frequently enough that we can track the progress.

The value of 10000 below means this output happens every few minutes on GPU and every ~10 minutes on CPU, a good balance.
"""
search = af.Nautilus(
    path_prefix=Path("imaging"),  # The path where results and output are stored.
    name="modeling",  # The name of the fit and folder results are output to.
    unique_tag=dataset_name,  # A unique tag which also defines the folder.
    n_live=100,  # The number of Nautilus "live" points, increase for more complex models.
    n_batch=50,  # For fast GPU fitting lens model fits are batched and run simultaneously.
    iterations_per_quick_update=10000,  # Every N iterations the max likelihood model is visualized in the Jupter Notebook and output to hard-disk.
)

"""
__Analysis__

We next create an `AnalysisImaging` object, which can be given many inputs customizing how the lens model is 
fitted to the data (in this example they are omitted for simplicity).

Internally, this object defines the `log_likelihood_function` used by the non-linear search to fit the model to 
the `Imaging` dataset. 

It is not vital that you as a user understand the details of how the `log_likelihood_function` fits a lens model to 
data, but interested readers can find a step-by-step guide of the likelihood 
function at ``autolens_workspace/*/imaging/log_likelihood_function`

__JAX__

PyAutoLens uses JAX under the hood for fast GPU/CPU acceleration. If JAX is installed with GPU
support, your fits will run much faster (around 10 minutes instead of an hour). If only a CPU is available,
JAX will still provide a speed up via multithreading, with fits taking around 20-30 minutes.

If you don’t have a GPU locally, consider Google Colab which provides free GPUs, so your modeling runs are much faster.
"""
analysis = al.AnalysisImaging(
    dataset=dataset,
    use_jax=True,  # JAX will use GPUs for acceleration if available, else JAX will use multithreaded CPUs.
)

"""
__Run Times__

Lens modeling can be a computationally expensive process. When fitting complex models to high resolution datasets 
run times can be of order hours, days, weeks or even months.

Run times are dictated by two factors:

 - The log likelihood evaluation time: the time it takes for a single `instance` of the lens model to be fitted to 
   the dataset such that a log likelihood is returned.
 
 - The number of iterations (e.g. log likelihood evaluations) performed by the non-linear search: more complex lens
   models require more iterations to converge to a solution.
   
For this analysis, the log likelihood evaluation time is < 0.001 seconds on GPU, < 0.01 seconds on CPU, which is 
extremely fast for lens modeling. 

To estimate the expected overall run time of the model-fit we multiply the log likelihood evaluation time by an 
estimate of the number of iterations the non-linear search will perform, which is around 10000 to 30000 for this model.

GPU run times are around 10 minutes, CPU run times are around 30 minutes.

__Model-Fit__

We can now begin the model-fit by passing the model and analysis object to the search, which performs the 
Nautilus non-linear search in order to find which models fit the data with the highest likelihood.

**Run Time Error:** On certain operating systems (e.g. Windows, Linux) and Python versions, the code below may produce 
an error. If this occurs, see the `autolens_workspace/guides/modeling/bug_fix` example for a fix.
"""
print(
    """
    The non-linear search has begun running.

    This Jupyter notebook cell with progress once the search has completed - this could take a few minutes!

    On-the-fly updates every iterations_per_quick_update are printed to the notebook.
    """
)

result = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

print("The search has finished run - you may now continue the notebook.")

"""
__Output Folder__

Now this is running you should checkout the `autolens_workspace/output` folder. This is where the results of the 
search are written to hard-disk (in the `start_here` folder), where all outputs are human readable (e.g. as .json,
.csv or text files).

As the fit progresses, results are written to the `output` folder on the fly using the highest likelihood model found
by the non-linear search so far. This means you can inspect the results of the model-fit as it runs, without having to
wait for the non-linear search to terminate.
 
The `output` folder includes:

 - `model.info`: Summarizes the lens model, its parameters and their priors discussed in the next tutorial.
 
 - `model.results`: Summarizes the highest likelihood lens model inferred so far including errors.
 
 - `image`: Visualization of the highest likelihood model-fit to the dataset, (e.g. a fit subplot showing the lens 
 and source galaxies, model data and residuals) in .png and .fits formats.
 
 - `files`: A folder containing human-readable .json file describing the model, search and other aspects of the fit and 
   a `.csv` table of every non-linear search sample.
 
 - search.summary: A file providing summary statistics on the performance of the non-linear search.
 
 - `search_internal`: Internal files of the non-linear search (in this case Nautilus) used for resuming the fit and
  visualizing the search.

__Result__

The search returns a result object, which whose `info` attribute shows the result in a readable format.

[Above, we discussed that the `info_whitespace_length` parameter in the config files could b changed to make 
the `model.info` attribute display optimally on your computer. This attribute also controls the whitespace of the
`result.info` attribute.]
"""
print(result.info)

"""
The `Result` object also contains:

 - The model corresponding to the maximum log likelihood solution in parameter space.
 - The corresponding maximum log likelihood `Tracer` and `FitImaging` objects.

It also contains information on the posterior as estimated by the non-linear search (in this example `Nautilus`). 

Below, we make a corner plot of the "Probability Density Function" of every parameter in the model-fit.

The plot is labeled with short hand parameter names (e.g. `sersic_index` is mapped to the short hand 
parameter `n`). These mappings ate specified in the `config/notation.yaml` file and can be customized by users.

The superscripts of labels correspond to the name each component was given in the model (e.g. for the `Isothermal`
mass its name `mass` defined when making the `Model` above is used).

"""
This script gives a concise overview of the basic modeling API, fitting one the simplest lens models possible.

Lets now consider what features you should read about to improve your lens modeling, especially if you are aiming
to fit more complex models to your data.

__Features__

The examples in the `autolens_workspace/*/imaging/features` package illustrate other lens modeling features. 

We recommend you checkout the following features, because they make lens modeling in general more reliable and 
efficient (you will therefore benefit from using these features irrespective of the quality of your data and 
scientific topic of study).

We recommend you now checkout the following features:

- ``linear_light_profiles``: The model light profiles use linear algebra to solve for their intensity, reducing model complexity.
- ``multi_gaussian_expansion``: The lens (or source) light is modeled as ~25-100 Gaussian basis functions.
- ``pixelization``: The source is reconstructed using an adaptive RectangularMagnification or Voronoi mesh.
- ``no_lens_light``: The foreground lens's light is not present in the data and thus omitted from the model.

The files `autolens_workspace/*/guides/modeling/searches` and `autolens_workspace/*/guides/modeling/customize`
provide guides on how to customize many other aspects of the model-fit. Check them out to see if anything
sounds useful, but for most users you can get by without using these forms of customization!
  
__Data Preparation__

If you are looking to fit your own CCD imaging data of a strong lens, checkout  
the `autolens_workspace/*/imaging/data_preparation/start_here.ipynb` script for an overview of how data should be 
prepared before being modeled.

__HowToLens__

This `start_here.py` script, and the features examples above, do not explain many details of how lens modeling is 
performed, for example:

 - How does PyAutoLens perform ray-tracing and lensing calculations in order to fit a lens model?
 - How is a lens model fitted to data? What quantifies the goodness of fit (e.g. how is a log likelihood computed?).
 - How does Nautilus find the highest likelihood lens models? What exactly is a "non-linear search"?

You do not need to be able to answer these questions in order to fit lens models with PyAutoLens and do science.
However, having a deeper understanding of how it all works is both interesting and will benefit you as a scientist

This deeper insight is offered by the **HowToLens** Jupyter notebook lectures, found 
at `autolens_workspace/*/howtolens`. 

I recommend that you check them out if you are interested in more details!

__Modeling Customization__

The folders `autolens_workspace/*/guides/modeling/searches` gives an overview of alternative non-linear searches,
other than Nautilus, that can be used to fit lens models. 

They also provide details on how to customize the model-fit, for example the priors.
