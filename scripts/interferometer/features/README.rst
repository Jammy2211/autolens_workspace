The ``modeling/features`` folder contains example scripts showing how to fit a lens model to interferometer data using
different **PyAutoLens** features.

The scripts in this folder are all recommended, as they provide tools which make lens modeling more reliable and efficient.
Most users will benefit from these features irrespective of the quality of their data, complexity of their lens model
and scientific topic of study.

Folders
-------

The following example scripts illustrating lens modeling where:

- ``pixelization``: The source is reconstructed using an adaptive rectangular or Delaunay mesh
- ``extra_galaxies``: Modeling which account for the light and mass of extra nearby galaxies.
- ``subhalo``: Fitting lens models for dark matter subhalo detection and sensitivity mapping.

Notes
-----

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/guides/results``.
