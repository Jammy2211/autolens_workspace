The ``modeling`` folder contains example scripts showing how to fit lens models to interferometer data:

Files (Beginner)
----------------

- ``start_here.py``: A simple example illustrating how to fit a lens model to interferometer data.

Folders (Beginner)
------------------

- ``features``: Example modeling scripts illustrating the core features for lens modeling.
- ``customize``: Customize aspects of a model-fit, (e.g. priors, the imaging mask).
- ``searches``: Using other non-linear searches (E.g. MCMC, maximum likelihood estimators).

Notes
-----

These scripts show how to perform lens modeling but only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/imaging/results``.
