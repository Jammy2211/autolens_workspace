"""
Modeling: Mass Total + Source Parametric
========================================

This script is the starting point for lens modeling of interferometer datasets (e.g. ALMA, VLBI) with
**PyAutoLens** and it provides an overview of the lens modeling API.

After reading this script, the `features`, `customize` and `searches` folders provide example for performing lens
modeling in different ways and customizing the analysis.

__Model__

This script fits `Interferometer` dataset of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens with a model where:

 - The lens galaxy's light is omitted (and is not present in the simulated data).
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear`.
 - The source galaxy's light is a parametric `Sersic`.

"""
__Mask__

We define the ‘real_space_mask’ which defines the grid the image the strong lens is evaluated using.
"""
real_space_mask = al.Mask2D.circular(
    shape_native=(800, 800), pixel_scales=0.05, radius=4.0, sub_size=1
)

"""
__Dataset__

Load and plot the strong lens `Interferometer` dataset `simple` from .fits files, which we will fit 
with the lens model.
"""
dataset_name = "simple"
dataset_path = path.join("dataset", "interferometer", dataset_name)

dataset = al.Interferometer.from_fits(
    data_path=path.join(dataset_path, "data.fits"),
    noise_map_path=path.join(dataset_path, "noise_map.fits"),
    uv_wavelengths_path=path.join(dataset_path, "uv_wavelengths.fits"),
    real_space_mask=real_space_mask,
)

dataset_plotter = aplt.InterferometerPlotter(dataset=dataset)
dataset_plotter.subplot_dataset()
dataset_plotter.subplot_dirty_images()

"""
We now create the `Interferometer` object which is used to fit the lens model.

This includes a `SettingsInterferometer`, which includes the method used to Fourier transform the real-space 
image of the strong lens to the uv-plane and compare directly to the visiblities. We use a non-uniform fast Fourier 
transform, which is the most efficient method for interferometer datasets containing ~1-10 million visibilities.
"""
settings_dataset = al.SettingsInterferometer(transformer_class=al.TransformerNUFFT)

"""
__Model__

We compose our lens model using `Model` objects, which represent the galaxies we fit to our data. In this 
example our lens model is:

 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` with `ExternalShear` [7 parameters].
 - An `Sersic` `LightProfile` for the source galaxy's light [7 parameters].

The number of free parameters and therefore the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space is N=14.

__Coordinates__

**PyAutoLens** assumes that the lens galaxy centre is near the coordinates (0.0", 0.0"). 

If for your dataset the  lens is not centred at (0.0", 0.0"), we recommend that you either: 

 - Reduce your data so that the centre is (`autolens_workspace/*/data_preparation`). 
 - Manually override the lens model priors (`autolens_workspace/*/imaging/modeling/customize/priors.py`).
"""
# Lens:

mass = af.Model(al.mp.Isothermal)
shear = af.Model(al.mp.ExternalShear)

lens = af.Model(al.Galaxy, redshift=0.5, mass=mass, shear=shear)

# Source:

bulge = af.Model(al.lp.Sersic)

source = af.Model(al.Galaxy, redshift=1.0, bulge=bulge)

# Overall Lens Model:

model = af.Collection(galaxies=af.Collection(lens=lens, source=source))

"""
The `info` attribute shows the model in a readable format.

[The `info` below may not display optimally on your computer screen, for example the whitespace between parameter
names on the left and parameter priors on the right may lead them to appear across multiple lines. This is a
common issue in Jupyter notebooks.

The`info_whitespace_length` parameter in the file `config/general.yaml` in the [output] section can be changed to 
increase or decrease the amount of whitespace (The Jupyter notebook kernel will need to be reset for this change to 
appear in a notebook).]
"""
print(model.info)

"""
__Search__

The lens model is fitted to the data using the nested sampling algorithm Dynesty (see `start.here.py` for a 
full description).

The folders: 

 - `autolens_workspace/*/imaging/modeling/searches`.
 - `autolens_workspace/*/imaging/modeling/customize`
  
Give overviews of the non-linear searches **PyAutoLens** supports and more details on how to customize the
model-fit, including the priors on the model.

The `name` and `path_prefix` below specify the path where results are stored in the output folder:  

 `/autolens_workspace/output/imaging/simple/mass[sie]_source[bulge]/unique_identifier`.

__Unique Identifier__

In the path above, the `unique_identifier` appears as a collection of characters, where this identifier is generated 
based on the model, search and dataset that are used in the fit.
 
An identical combination of model, search and dataset generates the same identifier, meaning that rerunning the
script will use the existing results to resume the model-fit. In contrast, if you change the model, search or dataset,
a new unique identifier will be generated, ensuring that the model-fit results are output into a separate folder.

__Number Of Cores__

We include an input `number_of_cores`, which when above 1 means that Dynesty uses parallel processing to sample multiple 
lens models at once on your CPU. When `number_of_cores=2` the search will run roughly two times as
fast, for `number_of_cores=3` three times as fast, and so on. The downside is more cores on your CPU will be in-use
which may hurt the general performance of your computer.

You should experiment to figure out the highest value which does not give a noticeable loss in performance of your 
computer. If you know that your processor is a quad-core processor you should be able to use `number_of_cores=4`. 

Above `number_of_cores=4` the speed-up from parallelization diminishes greatly. We therefore recommend you do not
use a value above this.

For users on a Windows Operating system, using `number_of_cores>1` may lead to an error, in which case it should be 
reduced back to 1 to fix it.
"""
search = af.DynestyStatic(
    path_prefix=path.join("interferometer"),
    name="mass[sie]_source[bulge]",
    unique_tag=dataset_name,
    nlive=50,
    number_of_cores=1,
)

"""
__Analysis__

The `AnalysisInterferometer` object defines the `log_likelihood_function` used by the non-linear search to fit the 
model to the `Interferometer`dataset.
"""
analysis = al.AnalysisInterferometer(dataset=dataset)

"""
__Run Times__

Lens modeling can be a computationally expensive process. When fitting complex models to high resolution datasets 
run times can be of order hours, days, weeks or even months.

Run times are dictated by two factors:

 - The log likelihood evaluation time: the time it takes for a single `instance` of the lens model to be fitted to 
   the dataset such that a log likelihood is returned.

 - The number of iterations (e.g. log likelihood evaluations) performed by the non-linear search: more complex lens
   models require more iterations to converge to a solution.

The log likelihood evaluation time can be estimated before a fit using the `profile_log_likelihood_function` method,
which returns two dictionaries containing the run-times and information about the fit.
"""
run_time_dict, info_dict = analysis.profile_log_likelihood_function(
    instance=model.random_instance()
)

"""
The overall log likelihood evaluation time is given by the `fit_time` key.

For this example, it should be around ~0.25 seconds, which is extremely fast for interferometer lens modeling. 
More advanced lens modeling features (e.g. shapelets, multi Gaussian expansions, pixelizations) have slower log 
likelihood evaluation times (1-3 seconds), and you should be wary of this when using these features.

Feel free to go ahead a print the full `run_time_dict` and `info_dict` to see the other information they contain. The
former has a break-down of the run-time of every individual function call in the log likelihood function, whereas the 
latter stores information about the data which drives the run-time (e.g. number of image-pixels in the mask, the
shape of the PSF, etc.).
"""
print(f"Log Likelihood Evaluation Time (second) = {run_time_dict['fit_time']}")

"""
To estimate the expected overall run time of the model-fit we multiply the log likelihood evaluation time by an 
estimate of the number of iterations the non-linear search will perform. 

Estimating this quantity is more tricky, as it varies depending on the lens model complexity (e.g. number of parameters)
and the properties of the dataset and model being fitted.

For this example, we conservatively estimate that the non-linear search will perform ~10000 iterations per free 
parameter in the model. This is an upper limit, with models typically converging in far fewer iterations.

If you perform the fit over multiple CPUs, you can divide the run time by the number of cores to get an estimate of
the time it will take to fit the model. However, above ~6 cores the speed-up from parallelization is less efficient and
does not scale linearly with the number of cores.
"""
print(
    "Estimated Run Time Upper Limit (seconds) = ",
    (run_time_dict["fit_time"] * model.total_free_parameters * 10000)
    / search.number_of_cores,
)

"""
__Model-Fit__

We begin the model-fit by passing the model and analysis object to the non-linear search (checkout the output folder
for on-the-fly visualization and results).
"""
result = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

"""
__Result__

The search returns a result object, which whose `info` attribute shows the result in a readable format.

[Above, we discussed that the `info_whitespace_length` parameter in the config files could b changed to make 
the `model.info` attribute display optimally on your computer. This attribute also controls the whitespace of the
`result.info` attribute.]
