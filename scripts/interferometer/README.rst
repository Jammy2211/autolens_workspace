The ``interferometer`` folder contains example scripts showing how to analyse galaxy-scale strong lenses with
interferometer data (E.g. ALMA, Radio Interferometers)

New users should read the ``start_here`` example, which gives an overview of all examples in the folder.

Results
-------

The ``modeling`` example performs lens modeling but only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the
results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/guides/results``.
