    every simulated strong lens without a subhalo, giving us the Bayesian evidence which we compare to the model which 
    includes one!). 

    For this model, we can use the result of fitting this model to the dataset before sensitivity mapping via the 
    mass pipeline. This ensures the priors associated with each parameter are initialized so as to speed up
    each non-linear search performed during sensitivity mapping.

    """
    We now define the `perturbation_model`, which is the model component whose parameters we iterate over to perform 
    sensitivity mapping. In this case, this model is a `NFWMCRLudlowSph` model and we will iterate over its
    `centre` and `mass_at_200`. We set it up as a `Model` so it has an associated redshift and can be directly
    passed to the tracer in the simulate function below.

    Many instances of the `perturbation_model` are created and used to simulate the many strong lens datasets that we fit. 
    However, it is only included in half of the model-fits; corresponding to the lens models which include a dark matter 
    subhalo and whose Bayesian evidence we compare to the simpler model-fits consisting of just the `base_model` to 
    determine if the subhalo was detectable.

    By fitting both models to every simulated lens, we therefore infer the Bayesian evidence of every model to every 
    dataset. Sensitivity mapping therefore maps out for what values of `centre` and `mass_at_200` in the dark mattter 
    subhalo the model-fit including a subhalo provide higher values of Bayesian evidence than the simpler model-fit (and
    therefore when it is detectable!).

    We now define the `base_model` that we use to perform sensitivity mapping. This is the lens model that is fitted to 
    every simulated strong lens without a subhalo, giving us the Bayesian evidence which we compare to the model which 
    includes one!). 

    For this model, we can use the result of fitting this model to the dataset before sensitivity mapping via the 
    mass pipeline. This ensures the priors associated with each parameter are initialized so as to speed up
    each non-linear search performed during sensitivity mapping.
    """
    base_model = mass_results.last.model

    """
    We now define the `perturbation_model`, which is the model component whose parameters we iterate over to perform 
    sensitivity mapping. In this case, this model is a `NFWMCRLudlowSph` model and we will iterate over its
    `centre` and `mass_at_200`. We set it up as a `Model` so it has an associated redshift and can be directly
    passed to the tracer in the simulate function below.

    Many instances of the `perturbation_model` are created and used to simulate the many strong lens datasets that we fit. 
    However, it is only included in half of the model-fits; corresponding to the lens models which include a dark matter 
    subhalo and whose Bayesian evidence we compare to the simpler model-fits consisting of just the `base_model` to 
    determine if the subhalo was detectable.

    By fitting both models to every simulated lens, we therefore infer the Bayesian evidence of every model to every 
    dataset. Sensitivity mapping therefore maps out for what values of `centre` and `mass_at_200` in the dark mattter 
    subhalo the model-fit including a subhalo provide higher values of Bayesian evidence than the simpler model-fit (and
    therefore when it is detectable!).

    """
    Sensitivity mapping is typically performed over a large range of parameters. However, to make this demonstration quick
    and clear we are going to fix the `centre` of the subhalo to a value near the Einstein ring of (1.6, 0.0). We will 
    iterate over just two `mass_at_200` values corresponding to subhalos of mass 1e6 and 1e11, of which only the latter
    will be shown to be detectable.

    We are performing sensitivity mapping to determine when a subhalo is detectable. Eery simulated dataset must 
    be simulated with a lens model, called the `simulation_instance`. We use the maximum likelihood model of the mass pipeline

    This is an instance of the `NFWMCRLudlowSph`, and it is different every time the `simulate_function` is called
    based on the value of sensitivity being computed. 

    In this example, this `instance.perturbation` corresponds to two different subhalos with values of `mass_at_200` of

    We can now combine all of the objects created above and perform sensitivity mapping. The inputs to the `Sensitivity`
    object below are:

    - `simulation_instance`: This is an instance of the model used to simulate every dataset that is fitted. In this 
    example it is a lens model that does not include a subhalo, which was inferred by fitting the dataset we perform 
    sensitivity mapping on.

    - `base_model`: This is the lens model that is fitted to every simulated dataset, which does not include a subhalo. 
    In this example is composed of an `Isothermal` lens and `Sersic` source.

    - `perturbation_model`: This is the extra model component that alongside the `base_model` is fitted to every 
    simulated dataset. In this example it is a `NFWMCRLudlowSph` dark matter subhalo.

    - `simulate_function`: This is the function that uses the `simulation_instance` and many instances of the 
    `perturbation_model` to simulate many datasets that are fitted with the `base_model` 
    and `base_model` + `perturbation_model`.

    - `analysis_class`: The wrapper `Analysis` class that passes each simulated dataset to the `Analysis` class that 
    fits the data.

    - `number_of_steps`: The number of steps over which the parameters in the `perturbation_model` are iterated. In 
    this example, `mass_at_200` has a `LogUniformPrior` with lower limit 1e6 and upper limit 1e11, therefore 
    the `number_of_steps` of 2 will simulate and fit just 2 datasets where the `mass_at_200` is between 1e6 and 1e11.

    - `number_of_cores`: The number of cores over which the sensitivity mapping is performed, enabling parallel 
    processing if set above 1.
