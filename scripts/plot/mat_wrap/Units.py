"""
Plots: Units
============

**PyAutoLens** has internal units which are used for lensing calculations and model-fitting (e.g. arc-seconds,
electrons per second, dimensionless mass units)

Visualization is performed in these internal units, however, the `Units` object allows the user to customize the
units of the figure (e.g. convert arc-seconds to kiloparsecs).

However, how to use the `Units` object to customize the units of a figure is not described here, but instead
in`autolens_workspace/*/imaging/results/examples/units_and_cosmology.ipynb`. Unit conversions in general is
described in this script.
