Plots: Plotters
===============

This example illustrates the API for plotting using `Plotter` objects, which enable quick visualization of all
key quantities.

You should refer to the `plots/start_here.ipynb` notebook first for a description of how plotters work and the default
behaviour of plotting visuals.

"""
__Array2D__

The `Array2D` object is base object which represents any 2D quantity (e.g. images, convergence, data).

It can be plotted using an `Array2DPlotter` and calling the `figure` method.
"""
array_plotter = aplt.Array2DPlotter(array=dataset.data)
array_plotter.figure_2d()

"""
__Grid2D__

The `Grid2D` object is a base object which represents a (y,x) grid of coordinates in 2D space, 9including image-plane
and source-plane grids.

It can be plotted using a `Grid2DPlotter` and calling the `figure` method.
"""
grid_plotter = aplt.Grid2DPlotter(grid=grid)
grid_plotter.figure_2d()

"""
We can ray-trace grids using a tracer (or galaxy, mass profile) and plot them.
"""

grid_plotter = aplt.Grid2DPlotter(grid=lensed_grid)
grid_plotter.figure_2d()

"""
__Tracer__

The `Tracer` object is a base object which represents a tracer of light through the universe, including
multiple galaxies and their light and mass profiles.

We can pass a tracer and grid to a `TracerPlotter` and call various `figure_*` methods to plot different attributes.
"""
tracer_plotter = aplt.TracerPlotter(tracer=tracer, grid=grid)
tracer_plotter.figures_2d(
    image=True,
    convergence=True,
    potential=True,
    deflections_y=True,
    deflections_x=True,
    magnification=True,
)

"""
A subplot of the above quantaties can be plotted.
"""
tracer_plotter.subplot_tracer()

"""
A subplot of the image-plane image and image in the source-plane of the galaxies in each plane can also be plotted 
(note that for  plane 0 the image-plane image and plane image are the same, thus the latter is omitted).
"""
tracer_plotter.subplot_galaxies_images()

"""
Whereas a `GalaxiesPlotter` had a method to plot its `plane_image`, it did not know the caustics of the source-plane as
they depend on the `MassProfile`'s of `Galaxy`'s in lower redshift planes. When we plot a plane image with a `Tracer`,
this information is now available and thus the caustics of the source-plane are now plotted.

The same is true of the `border, where the `border` plotted on the image-plane image has been ray-traced to the 
source-plane. This is noteworthy as it means in the source-plane we can see where our entire masked region traces too.

By default, this image is zoomed to the brightest pixels, so the galaxy can be clearly seen.
"""
tracer_plotter.figures_2d_of_planes(
    plane_index=1, plane_image=True, zoom_to_brightest=True
)

"""
If we do not want the image to be zoomed, we can pass `zoom_to_brightest=False`. 

This shows the full extent of the grid used to create the source-plane image, and may also include the caustics 
which the zoomed image does not due to zooming inside of them.
"""
tracer_plotter.figures_2d_of_planes(
    plane_index=1, plane_image=True, zoom_to_brightest=False
)

"""
A tracer consists of light and mass profiles, and their centres can be extracted and plotted over the image. 

The `visuals.ipynb` notebook, under the sections `LightProfileCentreScatter` and `MassProfilesCentreScatter`,
describes how to plot these visuals over images.

If the tracer has a mass profile, it also has critical curves and caustics. The `visuals.ipynb` notebook, under the 
sections `CriticalCurvesLine` and `CausticsLine`, describes how to plot these visuals over images.

__Imaging__

The `Imaging` object is a base object which represents an imaging dataset, including the data, noise-map and PSF.

It can be plotted using an `ImagingPlotter` and calling the `figure_*` methods to plot different attributes.
"""

    psf=True,
)

"""
The `ImagingPlotter` may also plot a subplot of all of these attributes.
"""
dataset_plotter.subplot_dataset()

"""
__Fit Imaging__

The `FitImaging` object is a base object which represents the fit of a model to an imaging dataset, including the
residuals, chi-squared and model image.

It can be plotted using a `FitImagingPlotter` and calling the `figure_*` methods to plot different attributes.
"""

It can plot of the model image of an input plane.

"""
fit_plotter.figures_2d_of_planes(plane_index=0, subtracted_image=True)
fit_plotter.figures_2d_of_planes(plane_index=1, subtracted_image=True)

"""
It can also plot the plane-image of a plane, that is what the source galaxy looks like without lensing (e.g.
for `plane_index=1` this is the source-plane image).

By default, this source-plane image is zoomed to the brightest pixels, so the galaxy can be clearly seen.
"""
fit_plotter.figures_2d_of_planes(plane_index=0, plane_image=True)

"""
fit_plotter.figures_2d_of_planes(
    plane_index=1, plane_image=True, zoom_to_brightest=False
)

"""
The source is often much fainter than the lens galaxy, meaning we may want to brighten its appearance to fully see it.

We can do this by passing the `use_source_vmax` bool, which sets the maximum value of the colormap to the maximum
flux in the source-plane.

This is used by default in the subplots plotted below.
"""
fit_plotter.figures_2d(data=True, use_source_vmax=True)

The `FitImagingPlotter` may also plot a subplot of these attributes.
"""
fit_plotter.subplot_fit()
fit_plotter.subplot_of_planes(plane_index=1)

It also includes a log10 subplot option, which shows the same figures but with the colormap in log10 format to
highlight the fainter regions of the data.
"""
fit_plotter.subplot_fit_log10()

"""
By default, the `residual_map` and `normalized_residual_map` use a symmetric colormap.

This means the maximum normalization (`vmax`) an minimum normalziation (`vmin`) are the same absolute value.

This can be disabled via the `residuals_symmetric_cmap` input.

"""
__Light Profile__

Light profiles have dedicated plotters which can plot their attributes in 1D and 2D.

We first pass a light profile and grid to a `LightProfilePlotter` and call various `figure_*` methods to 
plot different attributes in 1D and 2D.

Using a `LightProfilePDFPlotter`, we can make 1D plots that show the errors of a light model estimated via a model-fit. 

Here, the `light_profile_pdf_list` is a list of `LightProfile` objects that are drawn randomly from the PDF of a 
model-fit (the database tutorials show how these can be easily computed after a model fit). 

These are used to estimate the errors at an input `sigma` value of: 

 - The 1D light profile, which is plotted as a shaded region on the figure. 
 - The median `half_light_radius` with errors, which are plotted as vertical lines.

Below, we manually input two `LightProfiles` that clearly show these errors on the figure.

A light profile centre can be extracted and plotted over the image. The `visuals.ipynb` notebook, under the 
section `LightProfileCentreScatter` describes how to plot these visuals over images.

__Mass Profiles__

Mass profiles have dedicated plotters which can plot their attributes in 1D and 2D.

We first pass a mass profile and grid to a `MassProfilePlotter` and call various `figure_*` methods to
plot different attributes in 1D and 2D.

sections `CriticalCurvesLine` and `CausticsLine`, describes how to plot these visuals over images.

__Galaxy__

A `Galaxy` is a collection of light and mass profiles, and can be plotted using a `GalaxyPlotter`.

attributes in 1D and 2D.

We can plot 1D profiles, which display a properties of the galaxy in 1D as a function of radius.

For the 1D plot of each profile, the 1D grid of (x,) coordinates is centred on the profile and aligned with the 
major-axis. 

Because the `GalaxyPlotter` above has an input `Grid2D` object, the 1D grid of radial coordinates used to plot
these quantities is derived from this 2D grid. The 1D grid corresponds to the longest radial distance from the centre
of the galaxy's light or mass profiles to the edge of the 2D grid.

If we want a specific 1D grid of a certain length over a certain range of coordinates, we can manually input a `Grid1D`

major-axis. This means that if the galaxy consists of multiple profiles with different centres or angles the 1D plots 
are defined in a common way and appear aligned on the figure.

We'll plot this using our masked grid above, which converts the 2D grid to a 1D radial grid used to plot every

to map the visibilities, noise-map, residual-map or other quantitiy to a real-space image.

Bare in mind the fit itself uses the visibilities and not the dirty images, so these images do not provide a direct
visualization of the fit itself. However, they are easier to inspect than the fits plotted above which are in Fourier
space and make it more straight forward to determine if an unphysical lens model is being fitted.
