The ``examples` folder contains scripts which show how to use **PyAutoGalaxy** built-in visualization tools.

The API provides a simple interface with matplotlib for making plots that does not require the user to
write any matplotlib code themselves.

This is illustrated in the ``overview.py`` / ``overview.ipynb`` file, where new users should begin.

Files (Beginner)
----------------

- ``mat_plot.py``: Objects which wrap Matplotlib functions which customize a figure's appearance.
- ``plotters.py``: Plotters which plot specific **PyAutoGalaxy** objects (e.g. ``TracerPlotter``).
- ``searches.py``: Visualization tools for the results of a non-linear search (e.g. ``NestPlotter``).
- ``visuals.py``: Include visuals on a plot (e.g. a critical curve on an image).
