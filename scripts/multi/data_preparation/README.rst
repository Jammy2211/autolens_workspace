The ``multi/preparation`` folder contains example scripts preparing imaging / interferometer / point source data
for multi-data fitting.

Data preparation steps are the same as detailed in the ``imaging``, ``interferometer`` and ``point_source`` folders,
therefore the guides in these folders should be consulted for a detailed description of the steps.
