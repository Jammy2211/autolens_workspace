"""
Modeling: Pixelized
===================

This script fits a multi-wavelength `Imaging` dataset of a 'galaxy-scale' strong lens with a model where:

 - The lens galaxy's light is omitted (and is not present in the simulated data).
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear`.
 - The source galaxy's surface-brightness is an `Inversion`.

Two images are fitted, corresponding to a greener ('g' band) redder image (`r` band).

This is an advanced script and assumes previous knowledge of the core **PyAutoLens** API for lens modeling. Thus,
certain parts of code are not documented to ensure the script is concise.

The colors of the multi-wavelength image, which in this case are green (g-band) and red (r-band).

__Pixel Scales__

Every multi-wavelength dataset can have its own unique pixel-scale.

Load and plot each multi-wavelength strong lens dataset, using a list of their waveband colors.

__Mask__

Define a 3.0" circular mask, which includes the emission of the lens and source galaxies.

For multi-wavelength lens modeling, we use the same mask for every dataset whenever possible. This is not
absolutely necessary, but provides a more reliable analysis.

__Positions__

This fit also uses the arc-second positions of the multiply imaged lensed source galaxy, which were drawn onto the
image via the GUI described in the file `autolens_workspace/*/imaging/data_preparation/gui/positions.py`.
"""

__Analysis__

We create an `Analysis` object for every dataset.
"""

"""
__Model__

We compose a lens model where:

 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal` and `ExternalShear` [7 parameters].

 - This pixelization is regularized using a `Constant` scheme which smooths every source pixel 
 equally, where its `regularization_coefficient` varies across the datasets [2 parameter]. 

The number of free parameters and therefore the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space is N=9.
"""

    al.Galaxy, redshift=0.5, mass=al.mp.Isothermal, shear=al.mp.ExternalShear

)

source = af.Model(al.Galaxy, redshift=1.0, pixelization=pixelization)

model = af.Collection(galaxies=af.Collection(lens=lens, source=source))

"""
We now combine them using the factor analysis class, which allows us to fit the two datasets simultaneously.

We make the regularization coefficient a free parameter across every analysis object, ensuring different levels
of regularization are applied to each wavelength of data.

The `info` of the model shows us there are two models each with their own regularization coefficient as a free parameter.

"""
__Search__

The model is fitted to the data using the nested sampling algorithm Nautilus (see `start.here.py` for a 
full description).

__Result__

The result object returned by this model-fit is a list of `Result` objects, because we used a factor graph.
Each result corresponds to each analysis, and therefore corresponds to the model-fit at that wavelength.
"""

Plotting each result's tracer shows that the source appears different, owning to its different intensities.

The `Samples` object still has the dimensions of the overall non-linear search (in this case N=15). 

Therefore, the samples is identical in every result object.
