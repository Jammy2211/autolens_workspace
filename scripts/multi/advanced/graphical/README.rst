The ``graphical`` folder contains examples scripts illustrating how to fit a lens model to many lenses simultaneously
using graphical model, hierarchical models and expectation propagation.

**PyAutoFit** has dedicated tutorials describing graphical models, which I recommend users not familiar with
this approach to modeling read -- https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtofit/chapter_graphical_models.html.

The API for these features is the same irrespective of the dataset fitted. Therefore, please refer to the folder
`autolens_workspace/*/imaging/advanced/graphical` for example scripts, which can be copy and pasted
into scripts which model multi-wavelength datasets.
