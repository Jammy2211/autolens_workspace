# This tool allows one to input a set of positions of a multiply imaged strongly lensed source, corresponding to a set
# positions / pixels which are anticipated to trace to the same location in the source-plane.

# A non-linear sampler uses these positions to discard the mass-models where they do not trace within a threshold of
# one another, speeding up the analysis and removing unwanted solutions with too much / too little mass.

# Setup the path to the workspace, using a relative directory name.

# the positions will be output as '/workspace/data/data_type/data_name/positions.dat'.

# anticipated to map to different multiply imaged regions of the source-plane (e.g. you would need something like \
# spectra to be able to do this)

# Now lets plot the image and positions, so we can check that the positions overlap different regions of the source.
