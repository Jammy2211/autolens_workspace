# In this pipeline, we'll demonstrate signal-to-noise limiting - which allows us to fit ccd instrument where the noise-map
# has been increased to cap the maximum signal-to-noise value in the image in a phase of the pipeline. In this example,
# we will perform an initial analysis on an image with a signal-to-noise limit of 20.0, and then fit the image using
# the unscaled signal-to-noise map.

# Why would you want to limit the signal to noise? There are two reasons :
#
# 1) The model fitting, may be subject to  over-fitting the highest signal-to-noise regions of the image instead of
#    providing a global fit to the entire image. For example, if a lensed source has 4 really bright, compact, high
#    S/N images which are not fitted perfectly by the model, their high chi-squared contribution will drive the model
#    fit to place more light in those regions, ignoring the lensed source's lower S/N more extended arcs. Limiting the
#    S/N of these high S/N regions will reduce over-fitting. This is also important lens light subtractions which are
#    not perfect, which leave large chi-squared residuals due to the lens light's high S/N.

#    To learn more about this over-fitting problem, checkout chapter 5 of the 'HowToLens' lecture series.

# 2) If the model-fit has extremely large chi-squared values due to the high S/N of the data, this means the non-linear
#    search will take a long time mapping_util out this 'extreme' parameter space. In the early phases of a pipeline this
#    often isn't necessary, therefore a signal-to-noise limit can reduce the time an analysis takes to converge.

# Whilst signal to noise limits can be manually specified in the pipeline, in this example we will make the signal to
# noise limit an input parameter of the pipeline. This means we can run the pipeline with different signal to noise
# limits for different runners.

# We will also use phase tagging to ensure phases which use a signal to noise limit have a tag in their path, so it is
# clear what settings a phases has when it uses this feature.

# We'll perform a basic analysis which fits a lensed source galaxy using a parametric light profile where
# the lens's light is omitted. This pipeline uses two phases:

# Phase 1:

# Description: initialize the lens mass model and source light profile using x1 source with a signal to noise limit of 10.
# Lens Mass: EllipitcalIsothermal + ExternalShear
# Source Light: EllipticalSersic
# Previous Pipelines: None
# Prior Passing: None
# Notes: Uses a signal to noise limit of 10

# Phase 2:

# Description: Fits the lens and source model using the true signal to noise map
# Lens Mass: EllipitcalIsothermal + ExternalShear
# Source Light: EllipticalSersic
# Previous Pipelines: None
# Prior Passing: Lens mass (variable -> phase 1), source light (variable -> phase 1)
# Notes: No signal to noise limit.

    ### SETUP PIPELINE AND PHASE NAMES, TAGS AND PATHS ###

    # We setup the pipeline name using the tagging module. In this case, the pipeline name is not given a tag and
    # will be the string specified below However, its good practise to use the 'tag.' function below, incase
    # a pipeline does use customized tag names.

    pipeline_tag = al.pipeline_tagging.pipeline_tag_from_pipeline_settings()

    # When a phase is passed a signal_to_noise_limit, a settings tag is automatically generated and added to the phase
    # path,to make it clear what signal-to-noise limit was used. The settings tag, phase name and phase paths are shown
    # for 3 example signal-to-noise limits:

    # signal_to_noise_limit=2 -> phase_path=phase_name/settings_snr_2
    # signal_to_noise_limit=3 -> phase_path=phase_name/settings_snr_3

    # If the signal_to_noise_limit is None, the tag is an empty string, thus not changing the settings tag:

    # signal_to_noise_limit=None -> phase_path=phase_name/settings

    # This function uses the phase folders and pipeline name to set up the output directory structure,
    # e.g. 'autolens_workspace/output/pipeline_name/pipeline_tag/phase_name/phase_tag//'

    phase_folders.append(pipeline_name)
    phase_folders.append(pipeline_tag)

    # central regions of the image.
