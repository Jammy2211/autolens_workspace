# In this pipeline, we'll demonstrate binning up - which allows us to fit a binned up version of an image in a phse of 
# the pipeline. In this example, we will perform an initial analysis on an image binned up from a pixel scale of 0.05" 
# to 0.01", which gives significant speed-up in run timme, and then refine the model in a second phase at the input
# resolution.

# Whilst bin up factors can be manually specified in the pipeline, in this example we will make the bin up factor
# an input parameter of the pipeline. This means we can run the pipeline with different binning up factors for different
# runners.

# We will also use phase tagging to ensure phases which use binned up data have a tag in their path, so it is clear
# that a phase uses this feature.

# We'll perform a basic analysis which fits a lensed source galaxy using a parametric light profile where
# the lens's light is omitted. This pipeline uses two phases:

# Phase 1:

# Description: Initializes the lens mass model and source light profile using x1 source with a bin up factor of x2.
# Lens Mass: EllipitcalIsothermal + ExternalShear
# Source Light: EllipticalSersic
# Previous Pipelines: None
# Prior Passing: None
# Notes: Uses a bin up factor of x2

# Phase 1:

# Description: Fits the lens and source model using unbinned data.
# Lens Mass: EllipitcalIsothermal + ExternalShear
# Source Light: EllipticalSersic
# Previous Pipelines: None
# Prior Passing: Lens mass (variable -> phase 1), source light (variable -> phase 1)
# Notes: No binning up.
