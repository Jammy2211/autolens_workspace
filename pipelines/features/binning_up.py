# In this pipeline, we'll demonstrate binning up - which allows us to fit a binned up version of an image in a phse of
# the pipeline. In this example, we will perform an initial analysis on an image binned up from a pixel scale of 0.05"
# to 0.1", which gives significant speed-up in run timme, and then refine the model in a second phase at the input
# resolution.

# Whilst bin up factors can be manually specified in the pipeline, in this example we will make the bin up factor
# an input parameter of the pipeline. This means we can run the pipeline with different binning up factors for different
# runners.

# We will also use phase tagging to ensure phases which use binned up data have a tag in their path, so it is clear
# what settings a phases has when it uses this feature.

# We'll perform a basic analysis which fits a lensed source galaxy using a parametric light profile where
# the lens's light is omitted. This pipeline uses two phases:

# Phase 1:

# Description: initialize the lens mass model and source light profile using x1 source with a bin up factor of x2.
# Lens Mass: EllipitcalIsothermal + ExternalShear
# Source Light: EllipticalSersic
# Previous Pipelines: None
# Prior Passing: None
# Notes: Uses a bin up factor of x2

# Phase 2:

# Description: Fits the lens and source model using unbinned data.
# Lens Mass: EllipitcalIsothermal + ExternalShear
# Source Light: EllipticalSersic
# Previous Pipelines: None
# Prior Passing: Lens mass (variable -> phase 1), source light (variable -> phase 1)
# Notes: No binning up.

    ### SETUP PIPELINE AND PHASE NAMES, TAGS AND PATHS ###

    # We setup the pipeline name using the tagging module. In this case, the pipeline name is not given a tag and
    # will be the string specified below However, its good practise to use the 'tag.' function below, incase
    # a pipeline does use customized tag names.

    # to make it clear what binning up was used. The settings tag, phase name and phase paths are shown for 3
    # example bin up factors:

    # bin_up_factor=2 -> phase_path=phase_name/settings_bin_up_2
    # bin_up_factor=3 -> phase_path=phase_name/settings_bin_up_3

    # If the bin_up_facor is None or 1, the tag is an empty string, thus not changing the settings tag:

    # bin_up_factor=None -> phase_path=phase_name/settings
    # bin_up_factor=1 -> phase_path=phase_name/settings

    # This function uses the phase folders and pipeline name to set up the output directory structure,
    # e.g. 'autolens_workspace/output/phase_folder_1/phase_folder_2/pipeline_name/phase_name/settings_tag/'
