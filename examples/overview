Welcome to the **PyAutoLens** examples!

Here, you'll find example scripts of how to use **PyAutoLens**. If you're a new user, I recommend you inspect the
examples in the following order:

-> intro: An introduction to the **PyAutoLens** API.

    -> lensing.py: Perform simple ray-tracing calculations with light-profiles, mass-profiles and galaxies.
    -> fit.py: Fitting data of a strong lens.
    -> pixelizations.py: Reconstructing a lensed source galaxy's light on pixel-grid.
    -> point_sources.py: Modeling lensed quasars and supernovae as point-sources.
    -> interferometer.py: Performing lens modeling in the uv-plane of interferometer datasets.

-> model: How to fit a lens model to data with **PyAutoLens**.

    -> intro: Simple lens models fitting the lens galaxy's light, mass and source, using a parametric source model.
    -> inversion: Lens models which fit the source-galaxy light using a pixel-grid and `Inversion`.
    -> customize: API to customize the lens model parameterization and non-linear search.
    -> link: API to link results of one lens model to another.
    -> point_sources: How to model lensed quasars / supernovae / galaxies as point-sources.
    -> interferometer: How to fit different lens models to interferometer datasets.

-> plot: API for customizing visualization with **PyAutoLens**.
